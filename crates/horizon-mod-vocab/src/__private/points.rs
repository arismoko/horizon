//! Slot tables for injection points: the game's (in `mod_points`) and each mod crate's own (#2339),
//! one registry for all of them. A table has one activity flag per place, set once at the
//! seal where a mod listens. Registering a listener records its table, so the one [`seal`] after
//! the mods load sets every table that has listeners; a table nobody listens at is never touched,
//! and its inactive checks return `false`. Mod tables own atomic flags; the game's activity is
//! published into the dependency-free engine slot crate.
//!
//! Sealing orders each place's listeners: API ones before internals ones, a `replace` last among
//! the API ones, then priority descending, then registration order (the mods register in
//! dependency order), then inject id within a mod. Call sites keep mod-id tie ordering.
