//! Fluid interaction helpers, as NeoForge 26.3's `FluidUtil`: the common
//! case of a player right-clicking a tank with a bucket or any fluid container, in one call, with
//! the bucket's sound and game event, and a container picking up and placing fluid in the world
//! as a bucket does. Vocabulary over [`FLUIDS`], [`ITEM_FLUIDS`] at an [`ItemPlace`], the move
//! step of [`move_resources`](crate::move_resources) and the level's
//! [`pickup_fluid`](LevelRef::pickup_fluid) and [`place_fluid`](LevelRef::place_fluid): nothing
//! changes until a mod calls them.
