//! Items as holders (arismoko/horizon#41 §7): an item's own capability, such as
//! [`ITEM_ITEMS`] for a backpack's slots, reached where its stack lives. NeoForge 26.3 reaches
//! an item through an `ItemAccess`; here the place is an [`ItemPlace`], read and written as one
//! ([`ItemPlace::insert`], [`extract`](ItemPlace::extract) and
//! [`exchange`](ItemPlace::exchange)), so the inventory holding the stack is the one changed.
//! Handlers hold no borrow of the game, as block entity capabilities don't.
//!
//! A write runs in a transaction of its own, nested in the caller's, and changes the place where
//! it is, journaled: an abort puts it back, at every level of an item inside an item. A handler
//! answering more than it was asked is a mod bug, named once, and the write aborts.
