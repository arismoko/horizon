//! Typed state a block entity Part keeps on each block entity of its type (#781, #796).
//!
//! The value lives in the block entity's own attachment map, the store every other
//! attachment uses: it saves with the chunk through the type's codec, is kept by
//! transactions, and goes with the block entity when it is removed, replaced or
//! unloaded. The Part object is shared behaviour and owns no instance's value.
