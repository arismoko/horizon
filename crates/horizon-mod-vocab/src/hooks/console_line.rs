    #[notes = r#"## Console line

- **`console_line(host, event)`**: every line of the server's log, for a mod that mirrors the console elsewhere (a Discord console channel) or audits it. Paper has no event for this; plugins add a Log4j appender to the root logger. Lines are collected from every thread while a mod listens and handed over on the server thread at the next tick's start, so a listener may use the host. A line logged inside the hook is not heard again, so a listener that logs what it hears does not feed itself."#]
