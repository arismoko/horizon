    #[notes = r#"### Client attack targeting

`client_attack_target` runs with a ClientHost from the remote client's start-attack input path after interaction cancellation and before ordinary melee dispatch. Spear jabs bypass it. Cancellation suppresses attacks; an explicit target batch is deduplicated in first-occurrence order and each handle is checked for lifetime, reach, held-item range and occlusion. The server remains authoritative."#]
