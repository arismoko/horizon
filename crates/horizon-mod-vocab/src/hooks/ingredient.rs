pub trait Hooks {
    /// A recipe ingredient of a mod's own kind: the entry named a type in a
    /// namespace outside `minecraft:`, and the loader kept it for this call.
    /// The kind and the converted NBT compound the file wrote are here; fill `items` with the
    /// item ids the ingredient matches (item ids only: components are not
    /// checked here; a match-time hook follows separately). Duplicates are
    /// removed keeping first-seen order. The hook is called once per
    /// occurrence of the kind (nested inside a compound, intersection or
    /// difference too, and under any slot a recipe reads an ingredient from) in
    /// each load, before the load's tables parse the recipes, with the
    /// `DataLoadContext` of that owning load: the client's own recipe load has
    /// `origin()` `ClientPreload`, the server's has `ServerDataLoad`. A server
    /// loads its recipes once, however many tables and copies read them (its
    /// recipe tables, the stations and the copy synchronised to guests, on a
    /// dedicated server too), and a `/reload` asks again once; a client that
    /// only joins a remote server is never told `ServerDataLoad`. The answer
    /// must be the same every time. An empty list retains the custom
    /// predicate but makes the recipe unplaceable: the loader warns, omits
    /// property sets and stonecutter selection, and refuses book placement.
