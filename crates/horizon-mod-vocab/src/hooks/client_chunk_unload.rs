    #[notes = r##"## Client chunk unload

`native_client_chunk_unload(dimension, chunk)` runs on a client of a server once
for each column that leaves the client level, while its blocks and block
entities are still readable, just before they are freed. Every route a column
leaves by tells it: the server's `ForgetLevelChunk` packet, the view centre
moving away, the view radius shrinking, and the client level going (a dimension
change, a respawn into another level, leaving the server). A column that is
already gone is not told again. NeoForge tells only the forget packet
(`ClientChunkCache.drop`); Horizon tells every route, so a listener never keeps
state for a column the client no longer holds. `dimension` is the level the
column belonged to: on a dimension change, the old one."##]
