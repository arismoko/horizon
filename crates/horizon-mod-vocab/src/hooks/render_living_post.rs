    /// geometry to an arm or the head without animating it again; None for a model that isn't
    /// humanoid. The order today: before this hook its model, its vanilla layers and the mods'
    /// layers are drawn; after it, in the frame's later passes, its name tag, its leash, its
    /// flames and its shadow (the reference draws the leash and the name tag first, #3915). A type
    /// with a mod's registered renderer (`register_entity_renderers`) has its own model's order,
    /// the renderer in the model's place, so it changes with #3915 and not before. For a player,
    /// its `render_player_post` follows.
