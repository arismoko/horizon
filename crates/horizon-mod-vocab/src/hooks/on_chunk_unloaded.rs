    #[notes = r##"### When a block entity's chunk unloads

`on_chunk_unloaded` is NeoForge's `IBlockEntityExtension.onChunkUnloaded`: a `BlockEntityPart` attached to a mod
block entity type is told once for each block entity of that type in a chunk that unloads, so a machine with a
running job, an open handle or a place in a network it keeps can let go of it. `event.pos` is where it stands,
`event.block_entity` its handle, equal to the one `host.block_entity` gave while it was loaded (so a map keyed by
it finds the entry), and `event.entity` its type id and data as they are at the call: on a server, what the chunk
was just saved with; on a client, its copy as the server last sent it.

It fires on each side that holds a copy of the block entity. On a server it fires for each chunk that leaves a
level, a level that closes for being empty included, after the chunk was saved and before the block entity is
dropped. A chunk the server streams out has already left the level by then, so the handle's reads and writes
find nothing there (`None`, `Stale`): read what you need from the event. Changes made here, through the handle or
otherwise, aren't saved, as for `native_chunk_unload`. On a client (the window's own in single player included)
it fires when the server forgets a chunk or the view moves away from it, while the chunk is still there.

It fires once per block entity per unload and never for a vanilla block entity. It does not fire when the world
closes (that moment has `native_world_lifecycle`), nor on a client when its whole level goes (a respawn, a
dimension change, leaving the server). The chunk-wide notice stays `native_chunk_unload`, a server hook: on a server
it is told after the chunk's block entities, and a client is told of them alone. A chunk unload with no part
subscribed costs one check."##]
