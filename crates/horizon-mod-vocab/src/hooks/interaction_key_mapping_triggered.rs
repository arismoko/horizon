    /// arrow does not stick, a pearl does not teleport, a potion or a fireball

    /// eggs, pearls, potions, fireballs, wither skulls, wind charges, llama spit and
    /// shulker bullets, from players, mobs and dispensers. It does not fire for
    /// a breeze's deflection, for a hit on a wind charge, for fireworks or for
    /// fishing bobbers. A dragon part or End crystal is told by the id of the
    /// dragon or crystal. Heard only when a mod also sets
    /// `hears_projectile_impacts`. Server-side.
