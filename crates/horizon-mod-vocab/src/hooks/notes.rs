//! Notes that belong to no one hook or helper: the general catalog, counterpart and roadmap prose.
pub trait Notes {
    #[notes = r##"## Named hook catalog (draft)

The declarations map stable hook names and contract versions to source targets. A contract includes its signature,
timing and behavior: retain it or version incompatible changes. Injections name these with `hook` and `hook_version`.
Each listener's edited stack-list outputs are validated before leaving its scope. A refused output keeps the immediately
preceding accepted value; scalar outputs and cancellation still apply, and later listeners remain independent.
One warning per refused output names its owning mod, hook, output and conversion error. Native and wasm share this rule.

### Reading server blocks (draft)

A native server tick hook can call `native_server_block` with its context, a dimension id and a block position. It returns the block name and state properties from a loaded chunk. It does not load a chunk or open a dimension. Reads outside that hook, from a stale context, from unavailable dimensions or outside the world bounds return an error.

### Neighbour observations (draft)

`neighbor_changed` observes each authoritative server `neighborChanged` before the block handles it. It supplies the dimension, position, current owned `BlockState`, changed `BlockKey` and moved flag. The changed block key comes from the source block's default state through the prepared state index, after the primary state's routing guard. No registry-name lookup or allocation occurs on this path. Use explicit immutable block metadata for property queries; the hook does not load chunks or change the update queue. Its host is the level with its ticks (`&mut dyn LevelTicksHost`), as vanilla's `neighborChanged` gets the level: a `BlockPart::neighbor_changed` can read its inputs there with `level.signal(pos, direction)`, `direct_signal`, `direct_signal_to`, `best_neighbor_signal` and `has_neighbor_signal`, the same reads as `LevelRef`'s (mods' parts included), and schedule its own tick with `level.schedule_block_tick`, as a diode does (`DiodeBlock.checkTickOnNeighbor`). The reads write nothing and draw nothing, so they leave the update as it was, and cost what the game's own call does. `tick_block` and the other hooks with a `LevelWriteHost` have them too. Contract version `2`: version `1` handed the hook a plain `&dyn LevelHost`. Diverges from upstream.

### Server block changes (draft)

`block_changed` observes a committed authoritative server `Level.setBlock` change before block side effects and neighbour updates. It supplies the dimension, position and old and new state IDs. It does not observe chunk loading or direct storage writes that bypass `Level.setBlock`.

### Server commands and players

For mods that run where the world is simulated: a dedicated server, a LAN host, single player's server thread
(`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_server.rs`).

- **`register_commands(commands)`**: push a `Command` per usage, asked once when a world opens to
  players. A usage is words, then arguments `<name:kind>`, optional ones last in brackets:
  `Command::new("pay <player:player> <amount:integer>")`, `Command::op("eco set <player:player>
  <amount:integer>", 3)` for operators of level 3. Kinds: `word`, `text` (the rest of the line, last), `integer`,
  `number`, `boolean`, `player`, `item`, `block_pos`, and any command argument type a mod registered
  (`Registrar::register_command_argument`): its namespaced id is the kind, as in
  `<machine:mymod:machine>`. A custom argument is one word (or the rest of the line when its type says
  `Greedy`) and delivers its type's canonical value in `run_mod_command`. The usages of one command merge into
  one tree, which every player receives after vanilla's (filtered by their level, as vanilla's is), so their
  chat box completes and colours it. A client that does not know a custom type still parses and completes it:
  the tree sends the argument as a Brigadier string and asks the server for its suggestions. Fabric sends
  the registered argument type's id instead, which an unmodded client cannot read; the string keeps its
  tree valid. The server also parses player and console invocations against that tree, including each
  usage's permission and argument types, before calling a mod.
  Each executable usage keeps its own permission: an operator-only `foo` remains unavailable to ordinary players
  even if `foo bar` is public. Players can traverse the shared `foo` prefix to reach `bar`, but cannot execute
  `foo` itself. Optional arguments make their preceding prefixes executable at that usage's level; if several
  usages execute at the same prefix, its lowest executable usage level wins. A rejected usage does not change
  the permissions of accepted usages. When argument alternatives consume the same input without errors, an
  executable alternative takes precedence over a denied one; equally valid alternatives keep registration order.
  A name vanilla has, or a usage that doesn't parse, is left out with a warning in the log.

- **`run_mod_command`**: `event.command` is an owned `CommandInvocation` with its literal path, its `dimension` and
  `position` after `execute in/at`, and named `CommandArgumentValue` values, not raw command text. Integer, number and boolean
  values retain the dispatcher's types; word and greedy text are strings. Player selectors resolve to a single live
  `PlayerRef`, items become component-bearing stacks of one, and block positions resolve source-relative/local
  coordinates without requiring loaded chunks. `mod_id` is a loaded package id as a string; `resource:<registry>`
  is `CommandArgumentValue::Id`, an id that registry holds. A custom argument is `CommandArgumentValue::Custom
  { kind, value }`: its registered type's id and what its parser returned. Missing optional arguments are absent.
  Parsing, permission and resolution failures produce feedback without calling listeners. The console resolves from the Overworld spawn's
  block corner with zero rotation and no source entity (`@s` fails). Return `Flow::Cancel` when handled.
- **`armor_stand_manipulate(player, name, stand_id, slot, cancel)`**: a player takes an item from an armor stand or
  puts one on it, heard after the stand's disabled-slot checks and before anything moves. `slot` is `mainhand`,
  `offhand`, `feet`, `legs`, `chest` or `head`. Set `cancel` and nothing changes (the click is spent). The player's
  state is swapped in; `player` is their UUID. Not told of a click that changes nothing; breaking or blasting a stand and
  a dispenser armouring one are other ways its equipment moves and are not covered.
- **`vehicle_moved(player, kind, from, to)`**: a boat or minecart that carries a server player (`player`, its UUID)
  moved since the last tick, heard once a tick after the move with its positions before and after. The rider's state is
  swapped in, so `host.players().acting_player`, `PlayerRef::tell` and the item helpers reach them. A vehicle a player rode and left is
  still told of, with no `player` and nobody swapped in, until it has stood still for ten seconds. Mounts (horses...) and
  vehicles nobody ever rode are not covered. It only hears and costs one position compare a tick for each watched vehicle.
- **`container_opened(player, name, kind, pos, cancel)`**: a player is about to open one of the game's own menus
  (a chest, furnace, crafting table, villager, anvil, lectern, a horse's inventory...). `kind` is the menu type
  (`minecraft:generic_9x3`, `minecraft:merchant`...), `pos` the block it belongs to, none for a villager, a mount or a
  vehicle's chest. Heard after the checks that refuse the menu (a locked chest), before the open menu closes. Set
  `cancel` and nothing opens. The player's state is swapped in, so `host.players().acting_player`, `PlayerRef::tell` and the item
  helpers reach them. Menus a mod opens (`native_open_menu`) are not heard.
- **`creative_slot(player, name, slot, item, count, cancel)`**: a creative-mode player sets a slot from the creative
  screen (`slot` is the inventory menu's slot; below 0 is a stack thrown out of the screen), with the `item` (`minecraft:air`
  for an emptied slot) and `count`. Heard after vanilla's checks, before the slot changes. Set `cancel` and the packet is
  ignored. The player's state is swapped in. Stacks a creative player gets other ways (pick block, `/give`) are not heard.
- **`Hooks::player_game_mode_changed`**: a server player's game mode is about to change, from `event.from` to
  `event.to`, both `GameMode` (`Survival`, `Creative`, `Adventure`, `Spectator`): the `/gamemode` command, the
  F3+F4 switcher's packet and a hardcore world's respawn into spectator, once per change to a different mode. The mode a
  player joins with (`defaultgamemode`) is not heard. Write `*event.to` to send the player to another mode instead (each listener sees the previous one's choice); return `Flow::Cancel`, or leave `to` at the current mode, and the player keeps their mode. Inside the
  command and the switcher the player's state is swapped in; for the hardcore respawn it is not. The hook receives a
  `&mut dyn ServerHost`, and `event.player` identifies the player by UUID.
- **`player_changed_dimension(player, name, from, to)`**: a player changed dimension, once per move
  (`from` and `to` are ids such as `minecraft:overworld` and `minecraft:the_nether`), heard when the move has ended:
  the portal's exit is found and the player stands there, a command's teleport has landed, or a respawn in another
  level than the death's is placed for good. `to` is the level in place and the player's state is swapped in (as in
  `run_mod_command`), so `host.players().acting_player` and `PlayerRef::tell` reach them. Heard for Nether and End portals
  (also riding, and leaving the End as its winner), `/execute in ... run tp` and any command teleporting into another
  level, and the death respawn. Not heard: a move within a level (`/tp`, an End gateway), a player who leaves before
  the move ends, a respawn in the dimension of the death, and anything outside a dedicated server.
- **`player_toggle_flight(player, name, flying, cancel)`**: a player's client started (`flying`) or stopped
  flying, once per change, for a player who may fly (creative or spectator), on a server. The player's state is swapped
  in, so `PlayerRef::tell` and the other helpers reach them. Set `cancel` to refuse it: the player keeps the state they
  had and gets their abilities back, so the client lands or flies again. Only what a client asks for is heard: not the
  flight a game-mode change starts or ends, and not a LAN host's own player.
- **`player_switch_hotbar_slot_pre(player, player_entity_id, old_slot, new_slot, cancel)`** and
  **`player_switch_hotbar_slot_post(player, player_entity_id, old_slot, new_slot)`**
  (`PlayerSwitchHotbarSlotEvent.Pre`/`.Post`): a server player switches to a different hotbar slot. Pre runs after
  the slot range check and before it changes; set `cancel` to keep the old slot, and the client is sent that slot
  again. Post runs after the change. The player's state is not swapped in.
- **`furnace_burn(pos, fuel)`**: a furnace consumed `fuel` and started burning at `pos`.
- **`furnace_smelt(pos, item, result)`**: a furnace finished smelting `item` into `result` at `pos`.
- **`player_item_cooldown(player, name, item, ticks, cancel)`**: an item cooldown is about to start for a
  server player, including a used item's cooldown and a shield disabled by a hit. `item` is the item id and `ticks`
  its duration. Set `cancel` to skip the cooldown; shield disable still stops the use and plays its configured sound.
  The player's state is not swapped in.
- **`player_recipe_discovered(player, name, recipe, cancel)`**: a recipe id is about to become known to a
  server player through an advancement reward, a knowledge book or `/recipe give`. Set `cancel` to keep it locked;
  the client is sent the matching removal. The player's state is not swapped in.
- **`native_player_set_spawn(player, player_entity_id, name, dimension, pos, forced, cancel)`**: a server player's
  respawn point is about to be set, at each `ServerPlayer.setRespawnPosition` call: every sleep in a bed, a new respawn
  anchor point, `/spawnpoint`, and the copy to a respawned player (`pos` none for a player with no point). Set
  `cancel` to keep the old point.
- **`entity_travel_to_dimension(entity, dimension, cause, cancel)`**: a server entity is about to travel to
  the level `dimension`, before it moves (NeoForge's `EntityTravelToDimensionEvent`); `cause` is `nether_portal`,
  `end_portal`, `end_gateway` or `teleport` (a `/tp` or spectator teleport into another level). Set `cancel` to
  keep it where it is. Players and every other entity that crosses a portal or a command's teleport are asked;
  passengers are asked recursively, and a refused passenger stays behind, dismounted, with its own subtree.
  Discarding an entity in the callback prevents its travel. The player's state is not swapped in.
- **`block_damage_abort(player, name, pos)`**: a server player stopped digging `pos` before it broke. It is
  heard after the server clears the dig and sends the block state back to the client. The player's state is not
  swapped in.
- **`player_pick_item(player, name, from_entity, pos, entity_id, cancel)`**: a server player's middle-click
  pick resolved a block or entity's pick stack and is about to put it in the hotbar. For a block, `pos` is its
  position and `entity_id` is zero; for an entity, `from_entity` is true, `pos` is `[0, 0, 0]` and `entity_id`
  is its network id. The player's state is swapped in. Set `cancel` to leave the inventory and client unchanged. A
  pick with no result is not heard.
- **`native_sign_changed(player, name, dimension, pos, front, lines, cancel)`**: a player finished a sign they were
  editing, heard once every check has passed (editing that sign, in reach, not waxed, the chat filter) and right before
  the text goes on it. `lines` holds the four lines as written, formatting codes still in; rewrite them and that is
  what the sign gets (the chat filter does not look at it again), or set `cancel` and it keeps its old text. The
  player's state is swapped in, so `PlayerRef::tell` reaches them. Not told: the host's own editing on a LAN or
  single-player world, and changes that are no text edit (dye, glow ink, wax, `/data`, `/setblock`).
- **`player_client_loaded_world(player, name)`**: the server heard that a guest's client finished loading
  the level around them after joining, respawning or changing dimension. The player's state is not swapped in.
- **`player_stop_using_item(player, name)`**: a server player released the use-item key, or a mod's
  `release_using_item` did, before the item finished being used. The player's state is swapped in.
- **`player_recipe_book_settings_change(player, name, book, open, filtering)`**: a server player's recipe
  book open or filter setting changed; `book` is the book type's protocol id. The player's state is not swapped in.
- **`player_command(player, name, command, canceled, replies)`**: any command a player typed (without the
  slash), vanilla's too and commands the player may not run, heard before anything looks at it, and each line of a
  quiet command batch. Set `canceled` and nothing runs; push lines to `replies` and the player gets them as system chat
  (a quiet batch drops them). The player's state is not swapped in, and `PlayerRef::tell` and the other helpers that take a
  UUID reach nobody inside this hook: answer through `replies`. Commands may carry secrets (`/msg`, a login plugin's
  password), so don't log them carelessly.
- **`run_mod_command(source, command, ran)`**: executes a registered command with typed origin and
  permission. Feedback honours silence and track-output; set `ran` when handled, otherwise execution fails.
- **`player_respawned(player, name)`**: a dead player came back, once per respawn, on a server: after
  `PlayerList.respawn` reset their health, food and experience and placed them at their bed, anchor or the world spawn
  (NeoForge's `PlayerRespawnEvent`). The player's state is swapped in for the call, as for their other actions, so
  `native_player` and the other helpers reach them. A respawn at an anchor in another dimension, or
  at the world spawn's free column, may still move them on a later tick, once that level has loaded round them; the
  End-exit respawn (after the credits) does not fire it.
- **`player_login(player, name, cancel, reason)`**: a player the server has accepted (their name, the whitelist,
  bans and the player limit are checked) and who holds a place, heard before their saved state is loaded and before they
  are placed in a level (NeoForge's `PlayerNegotiationEvent`). Set `cancel` and they are disconnected with `reason` (a
  plain "Disconnected" when it stays `None`); no join message and no `player_logged_in` follow. It runs after the
  client's configuration, so the client sees the refusal as an in-game disconnect screen. The player is not placed yet,
  so no player's state is swapped in and `PlayerRef::tell` reaches nobody: the refusal text is the answer. Players the
  server refuses itself (name, whitelist, bans, a full server, the proxy's forwarding) are not heard.
- **`player_teleported(player, name, from, to, dimension)`**: a server player a command (`/tp`, `/teleport`,
  also what a mod's `run_command` reaches) moved, inside their level or into another; `from` and `to` are their feet
  before and after and `dimension` the level they are in now. Heard after the move has reached the player's state and
  their client (into another level: when that level is entered, before it has loaded around them), so it cannot stop it
  (NeoForge's `EntityTeleportEvent`). The player's state is swapped in, so `PlayerRef::tell` and the acting-player helpers
  work. Ender pearls and chorus fruit have their own hooks below; not heard yet: a spectator's teleport menu; portals
  and respawns are not teleports here.
- **`native_ender_pearl_teleport(owner, pearl, from, target, damage, cancel, hit_entity, hit_block, hit_face, hit_at)` (version 3)**: a server player's or mob's
  pearl landed and is about to teleport its live `EntityRef` owner. `target` may be moved; cancellation spends
  the pearl without teleport, sound, damage or endermite roll. Players retain acting-player context and
  mutable fall damage (5). Mobs preserve rotation, reset fall distance, take no player fall damage and
  make no endermite draw. The pending move refuses an owner changed by the listener. The hit fields say what the pearl hit (`getHitResult`): an entity (`hit_entity`, with the cell of `hit_at` and face `[0, 0, 0]`) or a block and its face normal.
- **`item_consumption_teleport(consumer, consumed, from, target, cancel)` (version 2)**: a server player or fox whose `teleport_randomly`
  consume effect (chorus fruit) is about to try a spot (NeoForge's `EntityTeleportEvent.ItemConsumption`,
  `TeleportRandomlyConsumeEffect.apply`): once per attempt, up to 16, after they stopped riding. A mod may move
  `target` (its y is kept inside the level's height); the game still looks down from it for ground to land on, inside
  the border. Canceling ends the effect: no
  teleport and no more attempts, but the food is consumed. `consumer` is a `LivingRef` and `consumed` is the
  captured stack before consumption (count and components included). A fox's listener receives the full server
  host before its living movement and before the next mob ticks; writes to actors or the level survive the
  continuation. Changing the consumer's mouth item, position or eligibility refuses the captured effect.
- **`player_clone(player, name, was_death, original)`**: after death (`was_death` true) or the
  credits-showing End return (false), after copying vanilla state and attachments and before placement.
  `player` is the replacement's UUID; `original: OriginalPlayerRef` lends read-only old state and all
  attachments, including non-copy-on-death and unserialized values. Inventory follows death drops
  (retained with keep-inventory or spectator) or is intact on End return. Reads expire after the hook;
  no subscriber means no snapshot. No state is swapped in. See `Hooks::player_clone` for full API docs.
- **`player_load_from_file(player, name, directory)`**: a joining player's saved state was read and applied
  (NeoForge's `PlayerEvent.LoadFromFile`, `PlayerList.loadPlayerData`), before they are placed in a level: once for each
  join on a server, for an integrated server's owner (loaded from the file `level.dat` names, else their own) as for
  anyone else. `directory` is the world's `players/data` folder, created if missing; read your own file there, named `<uuid>.<suffix>`. It
  is heard whether or not the player was in the world before (a new player has no file). No player's state is swapped
  in. It cannot change or stop anything.
- **`player_save_to_file(player, name, directory)`**: a placed player's data was saved (NeoForge's
  `PlayerEvent.SaveToFile`, `PlayerList.save`): when they leave or the world closes, when the dedicated server saves
  everyone, and for an integrated server's owner when the world saves their state into `level.dat`. `directory` is the
  world's `players/data` folder, created if missing; write your own file there, named `<uuid>.<suffix>`, and never the player's `.dat`.
  The player may be leaving, so no player's state is swapped in. It cannot change or stop anything.
- **`player_commands_sent(player, name, names)`**: the command tree a player is sent, when they join and when
  their level changes (`/op`, `/deop`, the LAN settings). `names` are the root commands their client would get, vanilla's
  they may use and the mods'; remove a name and that client's tree lacks it, so its chat box neither completes nor
  colours it. This hides the command from the client only, a typed one still runs (stop it with
  `player_command`). For a player already on, their state is swapped in and `PlayerRef::tell` works; a joining
  player has no world yet, so nothing can be told them. The tree the hub re-sends by itself (after a respawn or a change
  of level) reuses the last answer.
- **`player_sprint(player, name, sprinting)`**: a server player's client started or stopped sprinting (the sprint
  key, a double tap forward, letting go), once for each change, after the server's player took it. It only hears. It
  reports what the client asks, not what the server does: a sprint that ends by itself (a hit's knockback, hunger, a
  wall) is not heard. The player's state is swapped in, so `PlayerRef::tell` and the acting-player helpers work.
- **`resource_pack_status(player, name, status)`**: a server player's client answered a resource pack while
  playing (`ServerboundResourcePackPacket`): `status` is `Action`'s number (0 loaded, 1 declined, 2 failed download,
  3 accepted, 4 downloaded, 5 invalid URL, 6 failed reload, 7 discarded). It only hears. The pack a dedicated server
  offers during the configuration is answered before the player has joined and is not heard. The player's state is
  swapped in, so `PlayerRef::tell` works.
- **`native_projectile_hit(owner, kind, hit_entity, pos, cancel)`**: a projectile a server player launched (arrow,
  snowball, egg, thrown trident, ender pearl, ...) hit an entity (`hit_entity`) or a block at `pos`, heard before any
  of its effects (NeoForge's `ProjectileImpactEvent`). Set `cancel` and it does nothing: it vanishes, a thrown trident
  flies on through. The shooter's state is swapped in, so `PlayerRef::tell` answers them. Mobs' and the host's
  projectiles are not heard, nor are fishing bobbers and firework rockets.
- **`tnt_primed(player, pos, cancel)`**: TNT at `pos` is about to be lit by a flint and steel or fire charge
  (`player` is whoever clicked, whose state is swapped in), fire, a redstone signal, an arrow or a dispenser (`player` is
  None). Set `cancel` and it is not primed: the block stays, or is put back if fire or a signal had already taken it
  out. TNT set off by a blast, a TNT minecart and a sulfur cube are not asked; `explosion_detonate` can spare
  the blocks of a blast.
- **`hanging_place(player, name, kind, pos, cancel)`**: a server player places an item frame, a glow item
  frame, a painting or a leash knot (tying a lead to a fence that has none; `pos` is the fence), once it fits and
  before it is placed or the item used. Set `cancel` and nothing happens; the item stays in the hand. The player's
  state is swapped in, so `PlayerRef::tell` answers them. `/summon` and a lead tied to a mob are not heard.
- **`hanging_break(player, kind, pos, cancel)`**: an item frame, a glow item frame or a painting (`kind`)
  hanging in `pos` is about to break: a server player's hit (`player`, whose state is swapped in), a blast, or the
  wall it hangs on gone (`player` None for both), before anything drops or sounds. Set `cancel` and it stays as it
  was. A hit that only takes a frame's item out, the game's own player and `/kill` are not asked.
- **`bucket_empty(player, name, pos, fluid, cancel)`**: a server player empties a bucket (`fluid` is
  `minecraft:water`, `minecraft:lava` or `minecraft:powder_snow`; fish and axolotl buckets pour water) into `pos`,
  right before the fluid is placed. Set `cancel` and nothing is poured. The player's state is swapped in, so
  `PlayerRef::tell` answers them. `fill_bucket` hears the same click without the player and the fluid; dispensers
  and cauldrons are not heard. A fluid or mob bucket is also heard at the block beside the clicked face whenever that
  block is not `pos`, since a block that refuses the fluid passes it there; the fluid may still go into `pos`.
- **`player_bed_enter(player, name, pos, cancel)`**: a server player passed the sleep checks and is about to
  enter the bed at its head position. Set `cancel` to keep them out.
- **`player_bed_leave(player, name, pos, wake_immediately, update_level)`**: A server player is getting out of a bed (`PlayerWakeUpEvent`), heard before their sleeping state is cleared, so they still read as sleeping at `pos`, the head position. `update_level` is false for the morning wake of all players and true when the player got up; `wake_immediately` is true for generic stop-sleeping, missing-bed and death wakes, false for morning, explicit leave and bed-rule refusal; the hook owns the full caller table.
- **`player_edit_book(player, name, pages, signing, cancel)`**: A server player book-and-quill edit or signing packet is about to be applied. `pages` is its page count and `signing` says it has a title. Set `cancel` to drop the packet.
- **`player_shear_entity(player, name, entity_id, off_hand, cancel)`**: A server player is about to shear a sheep, mooshroom, snow golem or bogged. The hook gives the mob entity id and whether the shears are in the off hand. Set `cancel` to leave the mob and shears unchanged.
- **`player_advancement_done(player, name, advancement)`**: A server player completed an advancement after its progress was recorded. `advancement` is its identifier, such as `minecraft:story/mine_stone`.
- **`player_advancement_progress`**: A criterion of a server player's advancement was granted or revoked, after its progress changed and before any completion rewards, including the `minecraft:tick` criteria granted on a network player's first tick or a reload. The server-side event supplies `player` (UUID), `player_entity_id`, `name`, `advancement`, the changed `criterion`, and `progress_type` (`ProgressType::Grant` or `ProgressType::Revoke`). Its `progress` is an `AdvancementProgress` snapshot of this player's complete state at that mutation: all criteria in definition order with their original grant dates (or `None`), the requirement groups, the number of satisfied groups, and `done`. Each group is an OR of criteria; all groups must be satisfied, and an empty requirements list is not done. Clone the snapshot to retain it without borrowing the game; subsequent grants, revokes and reloads cannot change it. This is a read-only observation, not a way to write progress. A grant or revoke that changes nothing is not heard. The snapshot is built only when a listener subscribes.
- **`player_stat_award(player, name, stat_type, stat, value, cancel)`**: A statistic is about to be awarded to a server player, before its count and scoreboard criteria change. `stat_type` and `stat` are writable canonical namespaced strings, such as `minecraft:mined` and `minecraft:stone`, or `minecraft:custom` and a registered custom statistic. `value` is a writable `i32` amount. Unknown types or entries, noncanonical ids, and negative amounts reject the entire rewrite (warned once), keeping the original identifiers and amount. Set `cancel` to award nothing. Integrated and LAN servers apply the edits to counters, scoreboard criteria and dirty statistics packets. In a transaction, the hook and award wait for the outermost successful commit; aborts emit neither.
- **`player_riptide(player, name)`**: a server player launched with a riptide trident, after its velocity and spin are applied. The player's state is swapped in.
- **`player_fish(player, name, state, cancel)`**: a player's fishing rod, on a server: `state` 0 the cast, 1 a fish
  biting, 2 the reel-in of a bite (the catch), 3 the reel-in with nothing on the line, 4 the reel-in of a bobber hooked
  to an entity or item. Set `cancel` and nothing is thrown (0), the fish gets away and the wait starts over (1), or the
  bobber stays out with no wear on the rod (2 to 4). The bobber ending by itself (too far, rod put away, owner dead) is
  not heard, nor is the host of a LAN world's rod. The player's state is swapped in, so `host.players().acting_player`,
  `PlayerRef::tell` and the item helpers reach them.
- **`block_dispense_armor(dimension, pos, item, target)`**: a dispenser equipped `item` on the first eligible player, mob or armor stand in front of its block at `pos`. The equip, item consumption, sound and game event have completed; `target` names the kind of entity equipped.
- **`block_shear_entity(dimension, pos, entity, kind)`**: a dispenser sheared the entity of `kind` and id `entity` at the block in front of the dispenser at `pos`, after applying the shearing effects.
- **`block_receive_game(dimension, pos, block, event, cancel)`**: a sculk sensor, calibrated sensor or shrieker received the vibration `event`. Set `cancel` to suppress its response.
- **`brewing_start(pos, ingredient)`**: a brewing stand at `pos` starts its timer for `ingredient`, after it consumes fuel. Server-side.
- **`campfire_start(pos, item)`**: `item` was placed on the campfire at `pos` and began cooking. Server-side.
- **`block_cook(pos, item, result)`**: a campfire finishes cooking `item` into `result` at `pos`, before the result is dropped. Server-side.
- **`compost_item(pos, item)`**: a player adds a compostable item to the composter at `pos`, after its layer is applied. Server-side.
- **`crafter_craft(pos, recipe)`**: a crafter completed `recipe` at `pos`, after consuming its ingredients and handling its output. Server-side.
- **`player_attack_cooldown_reset(player, name)`**: a server player's punch was handled: the main-hand swing and attack-strength reset have both happened. The player's state is not swapped in.
- **`player_bucket_entity(player, name, entity_id, entity)`**: a server player caught a bucketable mob after the mob was removed and the filled bucket was put in the player's hand or inventory. `entity` is the mob species id.
- **`player_change_beacon_effect(player, name, pos, primary, secondary)`**: a server player's beacon selection was stored. Effect values are `Option<EffectKey>`, `None` when none is selected.
- **`player_deep_sleep(player, name)`**: a server player reached 100 ticks asleep in a bed and now counts as deeply asleep for the night-skip check.
- **`player_egg_throw(player, name)`**: a server player threw an egg after its projectile was launched and its use applied.
- **`player_elytra_boost(player, name)`**: a server player used a firework rocket to boost while gliding, after the rocket was launched and consumed.
- **`player_flower_pot_manipulate(player, name, pos, plant)`**: a server player put `plant` into the flower pot at `pos`, after its state changed and the item was consumed.
- **`player_insert_lectern_book(player, name, pos, book)`**: a server player put `book` on the lectern at `pos`, after the block entity and inventory changed.
- **`player_take_lectern_book(player, name, pos, book)`**: a server player removed `book` from the lectern at `pos`, after its block entity changed.
- **`player_lectern_page_change(player, name, pos, page)`**: a server player changed the lectern at `pos` to zero-based `page`, after its page and redstone pulse changed.
- **`player_item_frame_change(player, name, entity_id, action, item, rotation)`**: a server player changed a frame (`put`, `rotate`, `remove_item` or `break`), after its contents and comparator output changed. `item` is empty when none remains.
- **`player_item_mend(player, name, item, repair, experience)`**: an orb actually repaired `repair` durability on `item` for a server player, after the item changed. `experience` is the orb value.
- **`player_trade(player, name, entity_id)`**: a server player completed a villager or wandering trader trade, after the merchant applied it. `entity_id` is the merchant network id.
- **`trade_with_villager(merchant, kind, offer)`**: NeoForge's `TradeWithVillagerEvent`, heard once per trade a
  server player makes with a villager or a wandering trader (a shift-click that trades several times is heard for each),
  after the trade's statistic and `villager_trade` trigger. `merchant` is the trader's entity id, `kind` its type
  (`minecraft:villager` or `minecraft:wandering_trader`), and `offer` the `MerchantOffer` as it was right after the
  trade: its costs, `result`, `uses` (this trade counted), `max_uses` and `xp`. Listen only, heard once the whole click
  is done (its payments taken). The player's state is swapped in, so `host.players().acting_player` names
  them. Unlike `player_trade`, which is heard once per click with no offer. `MerchantRef` operations that
  conflict with an active menu operation are refused.
- **`player_shield_disable(player, name, ticks)`**: a blocked melee hit disabled the server player’s shield for `ticks` ticks. It fires just before the cooldown is set.
- **`player_loom_pattern_select(player, name, pattern)`**: a server player selected loom pattern button `pattern`, after the menu accepted it.
- **`player_name_entity(player, name, entity_id, entity_name)`**: a server player used a named name tag on a mob, after it became persistent and was named.
- **`player_open_sign(player, name, pos, front)`**: a server player opened the sign editor at `pos` for the front or back side, after the editor state was made.
- **`player_pickup_arrow(player, name, entity_id, item)`**: a server player picked up an arrow after it was removed and its pickup was applied. `item` is the pickup item id.
- **`player_stonecutter_recipe_select(player, name, recipe)`**: a server player selected stonecutter recipe button `recipe`, after the menu accepted it.
- **`player_swap_with_equipment_slot(player, name, slot)`**: a server player swapped their main hand with `slot` (currently `offhand`), after both hands changed.
- **`player_toggle_entity_age_lock(player, name, entity_id, locked)`**: a server player used a golden dandelion on an ageable mob, after its age lock changed and the item was used.
- **`player_unleash_entity(player, name, entity_id)`**: a server player's action removed an entity's leash, after its leash state was cleared.
- **`player_velocity(player, name, velocity)`**: the server synced changed motion to a player, with `velocity` in blocks per tick.
- **`player_stop_spectating_entity(player, name, entity_id)`**: a spectator's camera returned to their own player after they stopped watching `entity_id`.
- **`player_map_filled(player, name, map_id)`**: a server player filled an empty map, after the filled map and its saved map data were created.
- **`player_teleport_end_gateway(player, name, gateway, cancel)`**: a player is about to travel through the End gateway at `gateway`. Set `cancel` to leave them at the entrance; the gateway does not start its cooldown. The player is not swapped in.
- **`player_recipe_book_click(player, name, recipe, all)`**: a server player requests a known recipe be placed in their crafting grid through the recipe book. `all` is true for the shift click form. The player is not swapped in.
- **`player_exp_cooldown_change(player, name, ticks)`**: the player’s XP orb pickup cooldown changed, after its new value is stored. This includes the two tick delay after an orb is picked up and each tick it counts down. The player is not swapped in.
- **`entity_enter_block(entity, kind, pos, block)`**: a bee was stored in the beehive or nest at `pos`.
- **`entity_change_block(entity, kind, pos, from, to)`**: a mob changed a block, after the new state was applied.
- **`entity_break_door(entity, kind, pos)`**: a mob finished breaking a door at `pos`, after the block was removed.
- **`creeper_power(entity, lightning)`**: a lightning strike charged the creeper.
- **`living_visibility(entity, looking, visibility)`**: how visible `entity` is to `looking` (NeoForge's `LivingVisibilityEvent`, last in `LivingEntity.getVisibilityPercent`). `visibility` comes in as vanilla's percent: sneaking 0.8, invisibility scaled by armour cover, and 0.5 for a worn mob head whose default `mob_visibility` names the looking mob's type (a zombie head fools zombies, not husks). Multiply it to scale the range a targeting check sees the entity from. A negative answer counts as 0, and the result is clamped to 10, as vanilla clamps. It asks for a player, or for a mob (no sneaking factor: vanilla reads it through `isDiscrete`), seen by a mob whose targeting check scales by visibility (`TargetingConditions.testInvisible`): hostile targeting, the sensors, the happy ghast's tempt, a mob hunting a mob. It asks after the alive, spectator and selector checks, as `TargetingConditions.test` does. With no listener, `MobWorld::mob_hooks` is `None` and nothing is asked.
- **`entity_mob_griefing(entity, can_grief)`**: may `entity` change the world (NeoForge's `EntityMobGriefingEvent`, `EventHooks.canEntityGrief`)? `can_grief` comes in as the `mob_griefing` rule. Horizon asks with the entity responsible for the change: the exploding entity for a mob explosion, the owner for a mob's arrow or small fireball, the wither for its rose, otherwise the mob itself. A zombie breaking a door, the dragon breaking its walls, a ravager breaking pitcher crops, a burning mob melting powder snow and a weaving mob's cobwebs ask with that mob. Whether an explosion reaches items and decorations asks with the exploding entity, and whether a mob-caused blast harms decorations asks with that mob. A blast's vehicles and the ravager's roar on armor stands read the rule. The game asks through `Game::can_entity_grief` and the mob AI through `MobWorld::can_grief`. With no listener both read the rule: one `listened` check, no dispatch. A large fireball's fire asks for its owner: the ghast that shot it, or the player who sent it back. A fireball whose owner is gone reads the rule. The blast's block damage still reads the rule, because Horizon's mob explosion has no source entity yet.
- **`enderman_anger(enderman, player, cancel)`**: `player` stares at `enderman` (NeoForge's `EndermanAngerEvent`, last in `Enderman.isBeingStaredBy`, once the look cone, line of sight and carved pumpkin checks passed). It is asked each time the enderman's goals check the stare: to get angry, to freeze while looked at, and to teleport away up close. Set `cancel` and that stare doesn't count. The mob AI asks through `MobWorld::mob_hooks`, which is set only on the server while a mod listens: with no listener the stare check costs nothing more.

  Mob AI asks mods through `MobWorld::mob_hooks`, an `Option<&dyn MobHooks>`: one trait in the client lib, implemented once by the game, whose methods only build the hook's arguments and call its generated `native_*` entry. It is `Some` only on an authoritative server while a mod listens to one of its hooks, and each method is gated by its own hook's `listened`, so adding a method costs nothing to mods that don't listen to it. The hook gets a read `Host` over the game while the mob tick runs: the mobs being ticked and the level's random and attachments are lent to the tick, so through that host every mob's handle reads as gone and level attachments read as none. Use the event's own fields; anything that must write waits for a deferred hook.
- **`creeper_ignite(entity, player, item)`**: a player used a creeper igniter on the creeper, after it entered its ignited state.
- **`exp_bottle(pos, experience)`**: an experience bottle broke and its orbs were created.
- **`firework_explode(entity, pos, bursts)`**: a firework rocket completed its damage and explosion effects.
- **`potion_splash(item, pos)`**: a thrown splash or lingering potion finished applying its hit effects at `pos`. Experience bottles are excluded.
- **`entity_enter_love_mode(entity, kind, player)`**: a mob entered love mode after a player interaction; `player` is the feeder UUID when known.
- **`teleport_command(dimension, entity, from, to, cancel)`**: a server entity is about to be teleported by `/tp` or `/teleport`. `dimension` is the level it arrives in, `entity` its network id, `from` its feet now and `to` where the command sends it; move `to` to redirect it, or set `cancel` to keep it where it is (the command still reports success).
- **`entity_teleport(dimension, entity, from, to)`**: a server entity completed a same-level teleport command. `entity` is its network id; `from` and `to` are coordinates in `dimension`. This reports the move after it happens.
- **`entity_breed(parent, partner, child)`**: two mobs completed a breeding action. `child` is absent when the vanilla action lays an egg instead of creating a baby.
- **`entity_tame(entity, kind, owner)`**: a mob became tamed after its owner and persistent state were set. `owner` is the server player's UUID when known.
- **`item_spawn(entity, item, count, pos)`**: a dropped item entity was successfully added to the server level. The count is its stack size and `pos` is its spawn position.
- **`entity_pose_change(player, name, from, to)`**: a guest player's synchronized pose changed. Pose names are `STANDING`, `CROUCHING`, `SWIMMING`, `FALL_FLYING`, `SPIN_ATTACK` or `SLEEPING`.
- **`entity_toggle_glide(player, name, gliding)`**: a guest player's fall flying state changed after the server accepted or ended a glide.
- **`entity_shoot_bow(player, name, projectile, force)`**: a player fired an arrow from a bow or crossbow, after the arrow entered the level. `force` is the shooting power. This reports the completed shot.
- **`arrow_nock(player, name, bow, hand, has_ammo, cancel)`**: a player is about to start using a bow, where `BowItem.use` runs on the server (NeoForge's `ArrowNockEvent`). `has_ammo` is whether `getProjectile` found ammunition, always true in creative. Set `cancel` to fail the use: the bow is not drawn. Crossbows and tridents do not ask, and the client's own prediction does not.
- **`living_get_projectile(player, name, entity, kind, weapon, projectile)`**: the ammunition `LivingEntity.getProjectile(weapon)` returns (NeoForge's `LivingGetProjectileEvent`). Every mod gets the event with `projectile` set to the vanilla ammunition (the stack found in the hands or inventory, a mob's held projectile or a new arrow, a creative player's default arrow, or empty) and may change or empty it. It is asked on the bow's start and release, the crossbow's start and draw, the client's prediction of those starts, a skeleton's or illusioner's shot, and a pillager's or piglin's crossbow load (`entity` and `kind` name the mob, `player` is empty); a mob's arrow takes the replaced arrow's item and effect, a mob's crossbow also fires a replaced firework rocket, and an emptied stack leaves its crossbow uncharged and silent. A replaced stack is not taken from the inventory: the hook owns it.
- **`projectile_launch(player, name, entity, kind)`**: a projectile was added to the server level. `kind` is its entity type; `player` and `name` identify a player launcher, and are `None` and empty for other sources.
- **`entity_portal(dimension, entity, pos)`**: a server entity finished its portal wait and is beginning to leave through the portal block at `pos`. The destination follows the existing portal rules; the hook reports the transfer without changing it.
- **`furnace_extract(player, name, pos, item, count)`**: a server player takes furnace output at `pos`, after the output is removed; the player state is not swapped in.
- **`furnace_start_smelt(pos, item)`**: a furnace at `pos` begins cooking `item`, when its cooking timer first advances. Server-side.
- **`brewing_complete(pos)`**: a brewing stand finished brewing at `pos`, after the bottle contents changed.
- **`brewing_fuel(pos, fuel)`**: a brewing stand at `pos` consumed `fuel` and gained brewing fuel. Server-side.
- **`enchant_item(player, name, pos, item, levels)`**: a player applied an enchantment at `pos`; `item` is the finished item and `levels` the levels charged. Guest state is not swapped in.
- **`prepare_item_enchant(player, name, pos, costs)`**: enchanting offers were calculated at `pos`; change the three offer costs before they are sent to the player's menu. Guest state is not swapped in.
- **`anvil_update(host, event)`** (`AnvilUpdateEvent`, both logical sides): after `AnvilMenu.createResult`, change `event.update`'s output, XP cost and material cost, or cancel for no output at cost zero. `xp_cost` is signed and preserved exactly, matching `AnvilUpdateEvent.setXpCost(int)`. A Horizon client is shown that same cost, including one outside the vanilla data-slot short, so it does not change sign on the way. Zero and negative costs prevent taking the output, even in creative (`AnvilMenu.mayPickup` requires a positive cost); a negative cost does not refund levels. Negative material costs still clamp to zero, which consumes the entire right stack when a positive-cost output is taken.
- **`anvil_craft_pre(player, name, pos, craft, cancel)`**: a player took an anvil's result at `pos` (NeoForge's `AnvilCraftEvent.Pre`), before the levels are charged, the inputs used up and the anvil worn. `craft` has the left and right inputs and the result as they were before. Set `cancel` to refuse the take and skip `anvil_craft_post`: the result stays in its slot and the inputs, levels, inventory and cursor are as before the click. Fires on the server only; the window's predicted take does not call it.
- **`anvil_craft_post(player, name, pos, craft)`**: the levels, inputs and anvil wear of that take are done (NeoForge's `AnvilCraftEvent.Post`); a broken anvil is already air. `craft` is the same as in `anvil_craft_pre`. Not called when it cancelled.
- **`prepare_smithing(player, name, pos, result)`**: a smithing result was prepared for a player at `pos`; change it before it is sent to their menu. Guest state is not swapped in.
- **`prepare_item_craft(player, name, pos, result)`**: a crafting-grid result was prepared; `pos` is the crafting table, or None for the player's inventory grid. Change it before it is sent to the menu. Guest state is not swapped in.
- **`trade_select(player, name, villager, index)`**: a player selected offer `index` in a villager's trading menu; `villager` is its entity id when known. The menu has updated and the player's state is not swapped in.
- **`hopper_pickup_item(dimension, pos, item, count, cancel)`**: a hopper at `pos` is about to pick up a dropped stack; set `cancel` to leave it in the world.
- **`weather_change(dimension, raining, thundering, cancel)`**: the server's `/weather` command is about to set
  its final rain and thunder states in `dimension`. Set `cancel` to keep the previous weather parameters, including
  their timers.
- **`thunder_change(dimension, thundering, cancel)`**: the server's `/weather` command is about to change
  thunder. Set `cancel` to keep the previous thunder state and timer.
- **`lightning_strike(player, pos, cause, cancel)`**: a weather, Channeling-trident, or `/summon` lightning bolt
  is about to be created. Set `cancel` to prevent the bolt and its effects; `cause` names the creation path.
- **`entity_struck_by_lightning(entity, bolt, cancel)`**: a lightning bolt is about to hit `entity`
  (NeoForge's `EntityStruckByLightningEvent`), asked before vanilla's `Entity.thunderHit`, once per strike for each mob, player,
  item, vehicle or other entity whose box meets the strike box. Set `cancel` to spare it: no fire, damage or
  conversion, and `creeper_power` is not called. It still counts as struck for Channeling's advancement, as
  in NeoForge. A visual-only bolt asks nothing. With no listener the cost is one `listened` check per struck entity.
- **`time_skip(dimension, from, to, cause, cancel)`**: the server clock is about to jump after enough players
  sleep or through `/time set`, `/time add`, or `/time set <marker>`. Set `cancel` to keep the old time.
- **`sleep_finished_time(dimension, current, new_time)`**: enough players slept through the night and the
  `advance_time` rule is on (NeoForge's `SleepFinishedTimeEvent`). `new_time` comes in as the next morning's day time;
  set another to wake everyone then. A time before `current` is refused and the morning stays; the check runs once after
  every mod, so a later mod sees the value an earlier one set. It runs before `time_skip`, which hears the jump
  to the time chosen here and may still cancel it; the players wake either way.
- **`world_border_bounds_changed()`**: `/worldborder set` or `/worldborder add` changed the border size or started a timed size change.
- **`world_border_center_changed()`**: `/worldborder center` moved the border center. It hears successful commands only.
- **`spawn_change(pos, angle)`**: `/setworldspawn` moved the world's spawn point, after its position and rotation are applied.
- **`portal_create(dimension, pos)`**: a Nether portal built for dimension travel or the End arrival platform was completed in `dimension`; `pos` is its lower corner or platform origin.
- **`raid_spawn_wave(raid, pos, wave, raiders)`**: a raid wave is about to be spawned at `pos`; `raiders` is the count Horizon will spawn.
- **`raid_state_change(raid, pos, state)`**: a raid at `pos` was triggered or changed to `victory`, `loss`, or `stopped`. Its `RaidRef` identifies the owning level, not necessarily the level currently in place.
- **`world_saved(wait)`**: the server completed its world save cycle; `wait` is true when chunk writes were flushed before returning.
- **`entities_load(dimension, chunk, count)`**: saved entity records for `chunk` finished loading into `dimension`.
- **`entities_unload(dimension, chunk, count)`**: entities in `chunk` left the active world and were queued for saving.
- **`tab_complete(player, name, command, range, suggestions)`**: a guest's server completion request was evaluated; mods may add or filter suggestions. `range` is the replaced byte range. Guest state is not swapped in.
- **`broadcast_message(line, cancel)`**: a system broadcast line is about to be logged and sent to every player. A mod may change `line` or set `cancel` to drop the broadcast.
- **`whitelist_state_update(enabled)`**: the dedicated server's player whitelist was enabled or disabled.
- **`player_bundle_item_select(player, name, slot, index)`**: a server player selected an item in a bundle;
  `slot` is the packet's menu slot and `index` is the chosen item index.
- **`player_ready_arrow(player, name, arrow)`**: a server player released a drawn bow, by the use-item key or a
  mod's `release_using_item`, with `arrow` naming the selected projectile item. The player's state is swapped in.
- **`prepare_hopper_transfer(pos)`**: a hopper at `pos` begins a transfer attempt, after its cooldown and enabled checks and before pushing or pulling items.
- **`inventory_move_item(source, destination, item, cancel)`**: a hopper is about to move one item between containers (a composter's bone meal too). Set `cancel` to leave it in the source slot. A chest boat or minecart is reported at the block it is in.
- **`hopper_inventory_search(hopper, container, entity)`**: a hopper selects a block container or container entity while searching for items.
- **`vault_loot(pos, item)`**: a vault is about to eject a loot item, before the item entity spawns.
- **`world_border_bounds_change_finish()`**: a timed world border size change finished on the server, after the border reached its final size.
- **`player_launch_projectile(player, name, item)`**: a server player launched a snowball, egg, ender pearl,
  potion or trident. It fires after the projectile is created and only for guest players in a LAN world.
- **`entity_unleash(entity, kind)`**: a mob's leash was removed, before any lead drop is handled.
- **`entity_drop_item(entity, item, count, pos)`**: a mob is about to drop `count` of `item` at `pos`.
- **`item_despawn(entity, item, count, pos)`**: a dropped item entity reached its 6000-tick lifetime and is
  about to be removed.
- **`explosion_prime(center, radius)`**: a server explosion is about to begin at `center` with `radius`.
  It is listen-only, so the explosion proceeds as usual; it also fires on the single-player server.
- **`vehicle_damage(kind, damage, cancel)`**: a player is about to damage a boat or minecart. Change `damage`
  or set `cancel` to leave its damage and wobble unchanged; the attack still completes. `kind` is `boat` or the
  minecart type. Server-side.
- **`vehicle_destroy(kind, pos)`**: a boat or minecart is about to be destroyed at `pos`. TNT minecarts that
  prime instead of breaking are not heard. Server-side.
- **`vehicle_create(kind, pos)`**: a boat or minecart joined the level at `pos`, after being placed by a
  player or dispenser. Server-side.
- **`player_toggle_sneak(player, name, sneaking)`**: a guest's player input changed sneaking, after the hub applied the state. The guest's state is swapped in; only actual changes are reported.
- **`player_input(player, name, flags)`**: a loaded guest sent a `PlayerInput` packet, after its flags were applied to the hub. `flags` is the packet's bit field, and the guest's state is swapped in.
- **`player_arm_swing(player, name, hand)`**: a guest's arm swing was handled and their attack strength reset. The packet currently swings `mainhand`; the guest's state is swapped in.
- **`player_jump(player, name)`**: accepted guest movement made the server player jump from the ground, after movement simulation finishes. The guest's state is swapped in.
- **`player_kicked(player, name, reason)`**: a guest was kicked after the hub recorded the rendered disconnect reason and sent the disconnect. The guest's state is swapped in, unless the guest was already removed in the same poll (a kick and the disconnect arriving together): the hook still fires, without it.
- **`player_level_change(player, name, from, to)`**: a server player's experience change altered their level, after the new level was applied. The guest's state is swapped in when the player is a guest.
- **`player_swap_hands(player, name, to_main_hand, to_off_hand, cancel)` (version 2)**: a player pressed the swap-hands key (not a spectator), heard
  before the main and off hand items swap. `to_main_hand` starts as the off hand's stack and `to_off_hand` as the main hand's; the hands get what the listeners leave, and the client gets both slots when they changed. Set `cancel` and they stay where they are; the player's client
  is sent both slots again. The player's state is swapped in, so `host.players().acting_player`, `PlayerRef::tell` and the item
  helpers reach them. Heard for a server's players, the single-player owner and a LAN host. Not heard: the same swap from an open inventory (hovering a slot and pressing the key).
- Services: `host.players().server_players()` returns online player handles in connection order;
  `player.tell(host, text)` sends a system line to one player, also the acting player inside their hook;
  `host.messages().broadcast(text)`, to every player and the server's
  log; `native_server_event(name, uuid, message)`, an `announce` event on a dedicated server's event stream, which the Discord
  bridge relays when `[discord] events` lists `announce`; `host.commands().feedback(text)`, the command's answer to the player whose command it is; `native_world_dir()`, the
  open world's folder, where a server mod keeps its data in a folder of its own so the world's backups carry it.
- Items: a player's inventory is their [`ENTITY_ITEMS`](../concepts/capabilities/entity-items.md) handler, from any server hook.
- Experience: `native_experience_orbs(dimension, min, max)`, the orbs in a box (id, position, `value`, and `count`
  for merged orbs), read before a mod cancels an orb in `entity_join_level`; and a player's `give_experience_points(host,
  points)` and `give_levels(host, levels)` through their `PlayerRef`: points given as touching an orb gives them, Mending
  repairing their damaged items first, the rest going to their experience with the level-up sound; levels added or,
  negative, taken off (`Player.giveExperienceLevels`, as the anvil and the enchanting table charge; below 0 the level
  and points are 0; no level-up sound). Both return false for a player not here, dead, or swapped out by another
  player's hook, and where the server's player list is busy (some world ticks hold it): give first, and cancel the orb
  only when the give returned true. A merged orb is worth `value` × `count`.
- **`player_totem(player, name)`**: a totem of undying saved a player whose hurt would have killed them, on a server
  (`checkTotemDeathProtection`), heard just before it is used up. Listen only: the health state machine decides before a
  mod is asked, so a mod cannot veto it. The player's state is swapped in, so `host.players().acting_player`, `PlayerRef::tell` and the
  item helpers reach them. Not heard: the host of a LAN world.
- `host.players().acting_player()`, the player whose state is swapped in (inside `run_mod_command`,
  `right_click_block`, `native_use_on`, `break_block`...; None elsewhere);
  `host.commands().run_command(line)`, a command run as the server's console (level 4, no output), including during a guest's
  turn. The acting player and other live guests are reachable; displaced outer players are excluded only on this
  native path, without changing ordinary player or console command resolution. A teleport to another level
  (`execute in minecraft:the_nether run tp Alex 0 70 0`) lands at the next tick's start. The returned player handles read health through their living handle (0 once dead).
  `player.action_bar(host, text)`, a line over a player's hotbar, which also reaches the acting player inside their
  hook.
- **`food_level_changed(player, name, from, to, cancel)`**: the food level of a player is about to change, on a
  server (eating, hunger and saturation effects, exhaustion, starving), before the new level reaches them. Change `to`
  (0 to 20) or set `cancel` to leave it at `from`, saturation included. It is heard once for what one turn of the
  player changed, not for the full bar a respawn gives, the food a player joins with, or the host of a LAN world. The
  player's state is swapped in, so `host.players().acting_player`, `PlayerRef::tell` and the item helpers reach them.
- **`right_click_block(click, use_block, use_item, cancellation_result, canceled)`** : NeoForge's `PlayerInteractEvent.RightClickBlock`, a player's right click on a
  block, once per hand where `useItemOn` starts, on the clicking client and on the server (`click.side`). `click`
  (`BlockClick`) names the level, block, hit, hand, held stack and the player's UUID and entity id. `use_block`
  and `use_item` (`TriState`) force the block's use or the item's `useOn` off, or on (the block even while
  sneaking with something in either hand, the item even with an empty hand or while it cools down).   Default skips sneak with either hand full (both-stacks bypass remains open in #2934) and requires a held item off cooldown; forced empty use reaches `ItemAfterBlock` with no stack or Part.
  Adventure restrictions still apply. Cancelling skips both and answers `cancellation_result` (`InteractionResult`, default `Pass`, which goes on to the item's own use and the other
  hand); with `break_block`, a cancel with `Fail` keeps players out of claimed land, and the player's client is
  sent the block back.
- **`use_item_on_block(click, phase, cancellation_result, canceled)`**: NeoForge's
  `UseItemOnBlockEvent`, on both sides, immediately before the selected block or item-on-block phase.
  Canceling replaces that phase with `cancellation_result` (default `TryWithEmptyHand`), skipping its
  Part and template. `UsePhase::ItemBeforeBlock`, `Block` and `ItemAfterBlock` all fire; `ItemBeforeBlock` precedes the item's
  `on_item_use_first` Part.
- **`right_click_item(click, cancellation_result, canceled)`**: NeoForge's
  `PlayerInteractEvent.RightClickItem`, on both sides, before `Item.use` and its Part after target
  fallthrough. Canceling answers with `cancellation_result` (default `Pass`). `Success`,
  `SuccessServer` and `Consume` end the client's hand loop. Only `Success` predicts a swing.
- **`block_spread(dimension, kind, from, to, canceled)`** and **`native_piston_pre(dimension, piston,
  direction, extending, push, destroy, canceled)`** and **`piston_post(dimension, piston, direction, extending, push, destroy)`** (on `GameLevel`, like the block observers): a fluid flowing or fire
  spreading (`kind` `fluid` or `fire`) from `from` into `to`, and a piston moving blocks once its structure resolved (`native_piston_pre`, NeoForge's `PistonEvent.Pre`; `piston_post`, `PistonEvent.Post`, hears the move done).
  Canceled, the block at `to` stays as it is, and the piston moves nothing. Fluids ask on every flow: answer from
  memory, fast.
- **`block_ignite(dimension, player, pos, cause, cancel)`** (on `GameLevel`): fire is about to be placed.
  It covers fire spread, lava's random fire placement, lightning strikes, and dispenser flint-and-steel. Set `cancel`
  to leave the position unchanged. Direct player flint-and-steel/fire-charge placement is not covered.
- **`block_burn(dimension, pos, cancel)`** (on `GameLevel`): fire's burnout check is about to remove the block at
  `pos`. Set `cancel` to keep it.
- **`crop_grow_pre(dimension, pos, state, result)`** and **`crop_grow_post(dimension, pos,
  original_state, state)`** (on `GameLevel`): NeoForge's `CropGrowEvent.Pre` and `.Post`, at the random-tick growth of
  crops (beetroot and torchflowers after their own 1 in 3 skip), stems, nether wart, cocoa, sweet berries, bamboo,
  cactus, chorus flowers, sugar cane, kelp and the vines. `result` is a `TriState`: `Default` keeps vanilla's
  chance, `True` grows, `False` doesn't. Pre fires at the position that grows (the block above for cactus and chorus,
  the block grown into for kelp and vines). Vanilla's random roll is drawn first, in vanilla's order, and passed as
  the default, so crops keep vanilla's random sequence. Pitcher crops, bamboo saplings and mangrove propagules
  don't fire.
- **`dragon_egg_form(dimension, pos, cancel)`** (on `GameLevel`): the first Ender Dragon fight is about to place
  its egg at `pos`. Set `cancel` to leave the block unchanged.
- **`fluid_level_change(dimension, pos, fluid, from, to, cancel)`** (on `GameLevel`): flowing `water` or `lava`
  at `pos` is about to change level. Levels run from 0 through 8. Set `cancel` to keep the old level.
- **`neighbor_notify(dimension, pos, state, skipped_side, cancel)`** (on `GameLevel`): NeoForge's
  `NeighborNotifyEvent`. The block at `pos` is about to tell its neighbours it changed: `ServerLevel.updateNeighborsAt`
  (all six sides, `skipped_side` is `None`) or `updateNeighborsAtExceptFromFacing` (all but `skipped_side`). Set
  `cancel` and no neighbour hears, on both paths. Asked for every such update, redstone
  included: answer fast.
- **`create_fluid_source(dimension, pos, state, can_convert)`** (on `GameLevel`): NeoForge's
  `CreateFluidSourceEvent`. When the game works out a block's new fluid (`FlowingFluid.getNewLiquid`), it asks once
  for each horizontal neighbour that is a source of the same fluid, with that neighbour's `pos` and `state`; two
  counted sources over a solid block or a source make a new one. `can_convert` starts as the fluid's rule
  (`water_source_conversion` or `lava_source_conversion`). Spread checks work out new fluids too, so this is asked
  often: answer fast.
- **`leaves_decay(dimension, pos, cancel)`** (on `GameLevel`): a non-persistent leaf block at distance 7 is
  about to decay. Set `cancel` to keep it.
- **`inventory_block_start(player, name, pos, cancel)`**: a guest is about to open an inventory supplied by a
  block at `pos`. Set `cancel` to leave it closed. The guest's state is not swapped in.
- **`moisture_change(dimension, pos, from, to, cancel)`** (on `GameLevel`): farmland at `pos` is about to
  change moisture. Set `cancel` to keep its old moisture.
- **`sculk_bloom(dimension, pos)`**: after a sculk catalyst at `pos` takes experience, its block has entered
  the blooming state.
- **`sponge_absorb(dimension, pos)`** (on `GameLevel`): a sponge at `pos` has absorbed water and become wet.
- **`target_hit(dimension, pos, strength)`**: a projectile hit the target block at `pos`, which now has the
  reported redstone output `strength`.
- **`vault_change_state(dimension, pos, state)`**: the vault block at `pos` changed its state to `state`
  (`inactive`, `active`, `unlocking`, or `ejecting`).
- **`block_failed_dispense(dimension, pos, item)`**: a dispenser at `pos` failed to dispense `item`.
- **`beacon_state_change(dimension, pos, active)`**: the beacon at `pos` gained or lost its complete beam
  pyramid; `active` says whether it is active now.
- **`anvil_damaged(dimension, pos, from, to)`**: the anvil at `pos` took damage, changing from `from` to
  `to`; `to` is air when it broke.
- **`block_break_progress_update(player, name, pos, progress)`**: a guest's crack animation at `pos` reached
  progress stage 0 through 9.
- **`block_lock_check(player, name, pos, locked)`**: a guest checks the lock on the container at `pos`;
  `locked` starts with vanilla's result and may be changed. The guest's state is not swapped in.
- **`block_fade(dimension, pos, from, to, cancel)`** (on `GameLevel`): ice or snow melts, or coral dies. `from`
  and `to` are block state IDs. Set `cancel` to keep the old block.
- **`block_form(dimension, pos, from, to, cancel)`** (on `GameLevel`): precipitation is about to place ice or
  snow, or add a snow layer at `pos`. `from` and `to` are block state IDs. Set `cancel` to keep the old state.
- **`bell_ring(dimension, player, pos, cancel)`** (on `GameLevel`): a bell is about to ring. Set `cancel` to
  stop the ring and its raider reveal.
- **`native_cauldron_level_changed(dimension, player, pos, from_level, to_level, reason, cancel)`** (on `GameLevel`):
  precipitation, dripstone, or a burning player being extinguished is about to change a cauldron's level. Set `cancel`
  to leave it as it was.
- **`random_tick(ticks, dimension, pos, state, handled)`** (on `GameLevel`): a block `tickChunk`
  random-ticks, before its own `randomTick`. Change the block with the level's `native_set_block_property(ticks, pos,
  key, value, flags)`; set `handled` to skip the block's own random tick.
- **`tick_block(ticks, dimension, pos, state, handled)`** (on `GameLevel`): a due scheduled tick of a block
  that is still there (`ServerLevel.tickBlock`), before its own `tick`; the same contract as `random_tick`.
- **`explosion_detonate(dimension, center, blocks, entities)`**: the positions an explosion is about to
  break and the entities in its box, before any is hit; take out the ones to spare (not hurt, not pushed).
- **`explosion_knockback(dimension, center, blocks, entity, knockback_velocity)`**: a server explosion's
  calculated velocity, before it is added to the entity. Replace `knockback_velocity` to change the push;
  `entity` is None for a player, whom `host.players().acting_player` names. The player packet uses the same replacement. Wind bursts are heard too.

- **`fill_bucket(stack, pos, canceled)`** and **`attack_entity(entity, kind, pos, canceled)`**:
  a player's bucket at a block, and their blow on an entity, with the acting player swapped in. Canceled, the bucket
  does nothing and the blow does no harm. A fluid or mob bucket also asks about the block beside the clicked face
  whenever that block is not its target, since a block that refuses the fluid passes it there; the fluid may still
  stay in the target.

### Mobs

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_mobs.rs`: helpers for server mods, for the level in place, on a server only (on a
client they do nothing, and the readers give nothing). Each takes the `dimension` (`minecraft:overworld`) of the level it means, as
`native_set_block` does, and is refused when another level is in place. The per-level tick hooks run with a defined level in
place; `server_tick` does not define one, so name the dimension and expect a refusal there.

- `LevelRef::spawn_mob(host, kind, pos, reason)` spawns a mob and returns an `EntityRef`, or `None` when refused.
  `SpawnReason` controls finalization; the new mob is not persistent, as for a natural spawn. Spawn limits and natural
  spawn rules do not apply, as for `/summon`. A non-mob kind, invalid or out-of-bounds position, unloaded chunk,
  stale or unavailable level, or cancellation during finalization or level entry refuses the spawn. Configure the
  resulting entity through its handle rather than a spawn-options record.
- `native_mob(dimension, id)` and `native_mobs(dimension)` read the living mobs: id, dimension, kind, position, yaw, health and maximum health.
- A mob's health is set with `living.set_health(host, health)` on its `LivingRef`.
- `native_kill_mob(dimension, id)` kills as `/kill` does, with its loot. `EntityRef::discard` removes an entity without death or loot: from the call on selectors and handles no longer find it, its passengers are off and `entity_leave_level` has fired, in the same hook.
- While the game ticks its mobs they are out of the level: from a hook inside that tick, a spawned mob joins after the tick, and the others
  read as gone.

### Loot tables

Changing loot a mod didn't make, as NeoForge's `LootTableLoadEvent` and global loot modifiers and Fabric's
`LootTableEvents.MODIFY` and `MODIFY_DROPS` do. A mod's own loot function and condition kinds are #5451.
- **`living_death(entity, kind, source, weapon, cancel)` (version 2)**: server-only, before loot, experience and death messages. `source: &HurtSource` retains the accepted killing blow's damage type, real causing entity (including players), direct entity (including projectiles) and original optional position; `weapon: Option<&ItemStack>` retains its full killing stack and components. `LivingDeathEvent` exposes `entity`, `kind`, `source`, `weapon`, `cancel`; the old top-level `damage_type`/`attacker` fields and callback signature are removed, with no shim. Cancel suppresses death loot and leaves health exactly where the listener left it: health 5 stays 5; an unhealed body at health <= 0 is removed after 20 ticks without redispatch or loot.
- **`horizon_world::loot::loot_table_load(context, id, table)`**: each table's JSON as it loads, after the data packs'. `Hooks::loot_table_load` gets the owning load's `&dyn DataLoadContext` first (see "Items' default components"); its `origin()` is always `ServerDataLoad`, since only the server loads loot tables. Push a pool
  onto `table["pools"]` or an entry onto a pool's `entries`; chests, block and mob drops, fishing and the rest then roll the
  changed table. Keep a replaced table's `random_sequence`: a mob's table without one drops nothing. It runs once per table on
  each server data load and `/reload`, not on client preloads. It is a free function in
  `crates/horizon-world/src/loot.rs`, so a helper injected there compiles inside `horizon-world`, without `crate::game`.
- **`loot_drops(context, drops)`**: the items a broken block or a dead mob is about to drop, after its tables rolled (a
  mob's worn, held and carried items and inventory too, not an enderman's carried block or a copper golem's preserved equipment).
  Add, change or take out stacks; empty ones don't drop. `LootDrops` says what dropped them: its own loot table (empty when
  none rolled), the dimension, the origin, the block's position and state or the mob's id and type, the player who broke or killed
  it (100-tick player kill credit), the tool and explosion radius. Deaths carry `damage_source` (type, causing/direct IDs), `tool` is None, and `weapon_item(host)` reads the recorded projectile weapon or live melee weapon. It hears blocks
  that a player, an explosion or a mob breaks, not other breaks (leaves decaying, a torch losing its wall, a piston,
  `/setblock ... destroy`), nor a creative break or a tool that can't harvest the block. A block's stacks get its block entity's data (a
  shulker box's items) after the hook, and a container's contents spill on their own, not through it. A player's use drops
  through it too, with `used` set and that player named: shears on a sheep, a mooshroom, a snow golem or a bogged (its shearing
  table), a brush on an armadillo (`minecraft:brush/armadillo`) or a suspicious block (its item, no table), shears carving a
  pumpkin, picking sweet berries or cave vines (their harvest table), and a player's hit taking an item frame or its item (the
  frame's entity, no table). A dispenser's shears and an explosion's frames aren't told. Leads: untying one or cutting it with
  shears is a use (the leashed mob, no table), and a mob a player killed while leashed drops its lead on its next tick as a call
  of its own, naming the killer (`used` false, no table). A lead that snaps or loses its holder names no player and isn't told.
- **`native_living_drops(entity, kind, player, source, recently_hit, drops, cancel)`**: NeoForge's
  `LivingDropsEvent`, the whole of what a dying mob, server player or armor stand drops, after `loot_drops` and with the
  rest of `dropAllDeathLoot` in: an enderman's carried block, a copper golem's preserved equipment, and a player's inventory
  (unless `keepInventory`). Each `ItemDrop` holds the stack, position, motion and pickup delay its item entity gets, and
  its thrower, target (who alone may pick it up), no-gravity and starting age; an unedited drop spawns unchanged. `source` is a `HurtSource` (the damage type,
  `causing` and `direct` entity ids); the id of a projectile isn't kept, so `direct` is 0 for it. Edit the list or set `cancel`
  for no drops; experience orbs are separate (`living_experience_drop`). An armor stand fires it from `brokenByAnything`
  with an empty list, and its stand item and equipment pop outside the list, as in vanilla. `loot_drops` stays for loot that
  is not a death (blocks, shearing, leads); for a mob's death it is heard first (it edits the stacks a table rolled), and this hook
  then fires once on the whole collected list, with nothing spawned until it returns.
- **`native_get_equipment_drop_chance(entity, kind, slot, source, recently_hit, stack, original_chance, preserved, chance)`**:
  NeoForge's `GetEquipmentDropChanceEvent`. Change the chance a dying mob rolls for the item `stack` in `slot`; `original_chance`
  is the recorded chance before enchantments and `preserved` says the slot drops without a player kill. Each slot is asked at its
  own point of `Mob.dropCustomDeathLoot`, just before its roll, and the roll is drawn whatever the chance is.
- **`enchanted_entity_loot(entity, source, attacker, enchantment, level)`**:
  NeoForge's `EnchantedEntityLootEvent`. Change the level an entity's loot table uses of `enchantment`, in the middle of the roll:
  `EnchantedCountIncreaseFunction` and `LootItemRandomChanceWithEnchantedBonusCondition` ask each time they are evaluated, on a death and on
  `/loot ... kill`, whose `source` is `minecraft:magic` and whose `attacker` is the command's source. `entity` and `attacker` are live handles;
  `attacker` is None without one and may not be living, and `level` then starts at 0, otherwise at the living attacker's level. It is unsigned, so
  the negative levels `setEnchantmentLevel` throws on can't be written, and above 1024 it counts as 1024, so a mod's value can't size a loop. Without a listener the roll asks nothing, and its random's order is vanilla's.

### A mod block entity's data on its item

A mod's block entity carries its saved data on the item as vanilla's do: Ctrl + Pick Block, a loot function that copies the block entity (`minecraft:copy_components`-style) or a `/give` with `minecraft:block_entity_data:{id:"mod:type",...}` puts the compound (without `x`, `y`, `z`) in the item's `minecraft:block_entity_data`, and placing the item merges it into the new block entity before `native_place_block` runs, the counterpart of NeoForge's `BlockItem.updateCustomBlockEntityTag` and `BlockEntity.saveToItem`. Data tagged with another type is ignored. `/give` and `item replace` accept a type id a mod declared (its content's block entity types) and refuse any other as vanilla refuses an unknown one. The data is the compound the block entity saves, without its position and its components (`saveCustomOnly`): a component patch, a custom name say, rides as the item's own components and comes back as the block entity's on placing. A mod reads the data back in its own load as it does for a chunk.

### A block's items

A server mod reaches a block's items through its `ITEMS` capability ([parts](../concepts/parts.md)): `level.capability(host, &ITEMS, pos, side)` gives the block entity's slots as that side reaches them, by the rules hoppers follow (a furnace's sides, a double chest's two halves, a mod's `ModContainer` with its `faces`, `inputs` and `outputs`), and `move_resources(host, &from, &to, filter, max, tx)` moves items between two of them in a transaction. `side` is the side of the block being reached, so a pipe above a chest uses `Some(Direction::Up)`. A level not in place, a stale `LevelRef` and a client's copy of the world give none. `native_dimension()` names the level in place (`minecraft:overworld`) for a hook that isn't told it, such as `block_entity_tick`.

During a machine's own tick its block entity is out of the world, so it has no capability then: it has its slots in hand, in the `items` it's given. A composter has no block entity, so it has no `ITEMS`: hoppers fill and empty it. Container entities (minecarts, chest boats) aren't reached this way yet. A pipe keeps a neighbour's capability with `BlockCapabilityCache` instead of looking it up every tick ([keeping a block capability](../concepts/capabilities/keeping-a-block-capability.md)). A provider whose answer changes with no block change (a machine's side configuration) calls `level.invalidate_capabilities(host, pos)` (NeoForge's `invalidateCapabilities`): the capability generation there moves on, at the root commit inside a transaction and not at all when it aborts, and every cache there looks up again at its next `get`. `level.capability_generation(host, pos)` reads it; only its change means anything.

### Entities

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_entities.rs`: helpers for server mods, for the level in place, on a server only. Each
names the level it means by its `dimension` (`minecraft:overworld`), as `native_set_block` does.

- `native_summon(dimension, kind, pos, nbt)` spawns an entity of `kind` from its compound, as `/summon <kind> <pos> <nbt>`
  does (passengers included), and returns its id. None on a client, for another dimension, a position outside `/summon`'s
  bounds, a chunk that isn't loaded, a kind Horizon can't load, or one a mod kept out with `entity_join_level`.

A model that moves (a turning gun barrel, a thrown projectile) is an `item_display` showing an item whose model comes from
the mod's `.hmod` assets: summon it once, then move it and pose it with `DisplayRef` from a tick hook. Easing between ticks happens on each
client, so a call a tick looks smooth.

### Entity and level handles

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_entity_refs.rs` (#7387): an `EntityRef` names one entity of the open world and a
`LevelRef` one level. They are small `Copy` values a mod keeps, and their methods take the host, so a mod can hold
several at once: `host.entity(id)` makes one from the id an event carries, `host.level("minecraft:the_nether")` one from
a dimension.

An entity held out of storage while it is changed refuses handle reads and writes: reads return `None` and writes return
`false`. This includes cart and ridden-cart ticks, boat ticks (including ridden-boat leash ticks), and a copper golem turning into a
statue. A block entity also refuses its handle while it is being ticked. Tick hooks before and after that work can use
the handle normally.

The client also owns a world epoch, separate from the server's. It begins when a play login creates the
client level, changes when a dimension change or later login replaces that level, and retires after the
client logout hook or when reconfiguration clears the level. A same-level respawn keeps the epoch.
Client epochs do not fire server world lifecycle or server tick hooks. This bookkeeping does not make
the server entity and level reads available on a client; the reads listed under "On a client" below are.

On a client (`host.local_player()`, a client hook's `host`), these reads answer from the client's own copy, which is
what the server sent it (vanilla's `LocalPlayer`, `ClientLevel` and `Entity` fields), and are `None` for a stale
handle, an entity the client doesn't track and a level it doesn't show:

- `host.entity(id)` and `host.level(dimension)`: the local player or an entity the server told the client of, and the
  one level the client shows. `host.living(entity)` is the local player only.
- `entity.position(host)`, `rotation(host)` and `velocity(host)`: the client's copy, interpolated as it draws it.
- `entity.name(host)`: the synced custom name or type name, and a player's profile name, from either side's host.
- `level.block_state(host, pos)`, `block`, `block_property` and `is_loaded`: blocks of the chunks the client holds.
  A chunk it doesn't hold reads as unloaded; no read loads one.
- `level.day_time(host)`: the synchronized Overworld clock in ticks (counting past 24000), advanced at the
  server-supplied rate while the client level runs. This remains the Overworld clock in the End, even though
  the sky uses the End's own default clock. Only a handle for the level the client shows can read it.
- `living.equipment(host, slot)`, `hand_item`, `effect`, `effects`, `potion_affected` (`hasEffect`), `health` and `max_health`, for the local player.
  Another entity's equipment, effects and health stay server reads, and so does every write.
- `player.last_death_location(host)`, for the local player: the position the login and respawn packets carried.
- `player.inventory(host)` reads non-empty main inventory `ItemStack`s in slot order, with components. It returns `None` for a stale or unavailable player; on a client only the local player's inventory is available. Armor and offhand are separate equipment.
- For the local player, its own state as the server sent it (`LocalPlayer`): `player.game_mode(host)`, `is_creative`,
  `is_spectator` and `may_build` (the game mode of the login, respawn and `ClientboundGameEvent` packets); `food`
  (level and saturation from `ClientboundSetHealth`; the client keeps no exhaustion, so it reads 0), `needs_food`,
  `has_enough_food` and `can_eat`; `abilities` (what the game mode gives, then `ClientboundPlayerAbilities`' flags and
  speeds); `selected_slot` (the hotbar slot held); `experience` (`ClientboundSetExperience`) and
  `xp_needed_for_next_level`. Another player reads `None` there: the client is not sent their state.
- The local player's open menu: `host.local_player()` then `player.container_menu(host)` makes a `MenuRef` for the menu
  the client has open (the player's own inventory when none is), and `menu.slot_count(host)`, `slot(host, index)` and
  `carried(host)` read it as the server's `ClientboundContainerSetSlot` and `SetCursorItem` packets left it. Indexes are
  the menu's own slot order (the same `slot_backing` names), not network slot ids. Another player's menu is `None`, and
  so are `container_id` and `kind` on a client (server reads). A slot reads `Some(None)` when empty and the outer `None`
  when it doesn't exist or the menu is unavailable; a menu type the client has no slot map for reads `None` throughout
  rather than guessed contents. A handle goes stale, and reads `None`, when its menu is closed or replaced (a reused
  window id included), on a respawn, a dimension change or a logout, and after a reconnect. Nothing here sends a packet
  or changes the menu.

- `entity.position(host)`, `block_position`, `rotation` (yaw and pitch), `kind` (`minecraft:zombie`), `uuid` (`&mut`:
  an entity with no UUID yet gets its own) and `level` read the entity.
- `level.block_state(host, pos)` returns a typed `BlockState` without allocating a state string. For text such as
  `minecraft:oak_stairs[facing=east,…]`, pass the ID to `host.block_state_string(id)`. `block` (the name alone),
  `block_property(host, pos, key)`, `is_loaded`, `height` (lowest `y` and height), `game_time` and `day_time` read any
  level the server has loaded, not only the one in place. A block in a chunk that isn't loaded or a `y` outside
  the world's height reads as `None`. `level.brightness(host, LightLayer::Block | Sky, pos)` reads the stored light
  (`getBrightness`) the same way, as the game's own light query holds it, and is `None` where the block read is.
  `level.height(host)` (`LevelHeightAccessor.getMinY`, `getHeight`) also works with `&dyn Host` in client
  hooks, including render, screen and mouse hooks. Obtain the handle with `host.level(dimension)`; on a
  client only its current dimension is available, after login. It reads that client's synchronized level
  shape, without loading chunks or allocating. A stale handle, logout or a different dimension returns
  `None`, not guessed Overworld bounds. On a server it still reads parked loaded levels as well.
  `level.fluid_state(host, pos)` reads the fluid there the same way.
  `level.fluid_flow(host, pos)` (`FluidState.getFlow`) reads its current as a `Vec3`, through the function that pushes
  entities, so a `fluid_flow` listener's change is what it reads: zero where no fluid flows, `None` where the block read
  is. It reads on a client too, from the client's own copy of the level. It costs what one entity's push by that block
  does: up to twelve block reads around `pos` (the four neighbours and below them; falling fluid also checks
  their faces), with no allocation, plus the `fluid_flow` listeners.
- `level.weather(host)` reads rain and thunder levels on **both sides**, using the shared `Host` from server,
  render, screen or mouse hooks. It returns `Some((rain, thunder))`, each 0.0 to 1.0, at partial tick 1.0
  (`Level.getRainLevel` / `getThunderLevel`, with thunder scaled by rain). Both are 0 where the level cannot have
  weather. A server can read any open level, including parked levels; a client reads only its current synchronized
  level after login. Stale handles and unavailable levels return `None`; the read never loads a level.
- `level.seed(host)`, `difficulty` (`"normal"`, as `/difficulty` names it), `game_rule(host, "keep_inventory")` (a
  `GameRuleValue`, `Bool` or `Int`; None for an unknown rule), `game_rules` (every rule as a `minecraft:` id and its
  value), `is_raining` and `is_thundering` read its server settings.
  `level.is_raining_at(host, pos)` (`Level.isRainingAt`) asks about one position of any open level: it rains there, the
  position has full sky light with nothing motion-blocking or fluid above it, and its biome's precipitation at that
  height is rain (not snow or none). It is `None` where the block read is, an unloaded chunk or a `y` outside the
  world. `level.enabled_features(host)` is the world's `FeatureFlags` (`LevelReader.enabledFeatures`:
  `contains("minecraft:redstone_experiments")`, `iter()`); every level of a world shares them, and a world that
  names none enables `minecraft:vanilla`.
- `level.chunk_ref(host, [x, z])` makes a `ChunkRef` for any chunk of an open level, loaded or not (None past 30 million
  blocks). `chunk.forced(host)` and `level.forced_chunks(host)` read the chunks `/forceload` holds (`/forceload query`);
  `chunk.set_forced(host, bool)` is `/forceload add` or `remove` of one chunk and returns whether the set changed. That
  is the world's own state: it is saved with the level and stays until `/forceload remove`.
  A newly added forced chunk is loaded before the call returns, including in a parked server level. Repeated adds
  and removals do not load chunks.
- Ticket controllers (NeoForge's `TicketController`, registered in `RegisterTicketControllersEvent`): a mod registers
  each one once at startup, from `Hooks::register`, with `r.register_ticket_controller("quarry", validates)` and keeps the
  `TicketController` it returns (it is `Copy`; `Hooks` methods take `&self`, so a `OnceLock` holds it). The id is the
  calling mod's: `quarry` and `mymod:quarry` both become `mymod:quarry`, and another mod's namespace refuses the mods at
  startup, as does an id registered twice (the error names the mod and the id). `validates` is whether the controller
  validates its saved tickets (NeoForge's `LoadingValidationCallback`, below). The handle is only made by the registrar
  and indexes the installed table, so a ticket call looks up no string. Another mod's controller does nothing.
- `chunk.set_mod_forced(host, controller, owner, forced, natural_spawning)` (NeoForge's `TicketController.forceChunk`)
  holds or releases a chunk through `controller` and returns whether its tickets changed. `owner` is a
  `TicketOwner`, `Block([x, y, z])` or `Entity(uuid)`. A ticket is scoped by controller, owner, chunk and
  `natural_spawning`, so two owners in one chunk release separately, one owner holds a plain and a natural-spawning
  ticket on a chunk apart, and two controllers of one mod never touch each other's. The chunk stays loaded, entity
  ticking and saved, and its level keeps ticking, while any ticket or `/forceload` holds it. With `natural_spawning`, the
  chunk joins the spawning chunks (`ChunkMap.collectSpawningChunks`, within 8 chunks of
  a player): it gets inhabited time, thunder and a spawn attempt. The local mob cap then lets mobs spawn there only
  while a non-spectator player is within 128 blocks of the chunk's centre, as vanilla's
  `LocalMobCapCalculator` decides. `level.mod_forced_chunks(host, controller)` lists the controller's tickets as
  `(owner, [x, z], natural_spawning)`. Tickets are saved in `data/horizon/mod_chunk_tickets.dat`, never in vanilla's
  `chunk_tickets.dat`, under the controller's id. When a world loads, the tickets of an id no loaded mod registers are
  dropped with a warning in the log, as NeoForge documents for a controller nobody registers; so are tickets from a
  file written before controllers, which are keyed by mod id. Outside a mod's hook, for another mod's controller, and for
  a stale handle or a chunk past the world's bounds, the calls return `false` or `None`.
- `validate_tickets` (NeoForge's `LoadingValidationCallback.validateTickets`, server) fires for each level that opens,
  after `level_load` and before its first tick, once for each controller registered with `validates` that has saved
  tickets in the level, and only to mods that implement it. `event.controller` is the controller; its owning mod's
  `event.validation` shows that controller's tickets read from the save when the level loaded, before they take hold
  (NeoForge's `TicketHelper` is per controller): a ticket a mod adds in `level_load` is not among them and is never
  removed by it, and a ticket of another controller is not shown. Every mod that implements the hook is called, but
  only the owner's view holds anything; a controller without a validator keeps all of its tickets. The tickets that
  survive then force their chunks. `block_tickets()` gives each block position and `entity_tickets()` each entity UUID
  with a `TicketSet`, the chunks it
  holds apart by kind (`non_natural_spawning` and `natural_spawning`, as NeoForge's `TicketSet`). A plain and a
  natural-spawning ticket on one chunk are two tickets. `remove_block_tickets(pos)` and `remove_entity_tickets(uuid)`
  remove everything an owner holds, both kinds (and return how many); `remove_block_ticket(pos, chunk, natural_spawning)`
  and `remove_entity_ticket(uuid, chunk, natural_spawning)` remove the one kind they name and leave the other. A removed ticket never
  forces its chunk and is left out of the next save.
- `host.living(entity)` gives a `LivingRef` for a mob, a player, an armor stand or the dragon (vanilla's
  `LivingEntity`); `living.entity()` goes back. `living.equipment(host, EquipmentSlot::Head)` and `hand_item(host,
  Hand::Main)` read its equipment (an empty slot reads as `None`); `set_equipment(host, slot, stack)` puts a stack in a
  slot as `LivingEntity.setItemSlot` does (None or air empties it), and `set_hand_item(host, hand, stack)` puts one in
  a hand as `LivingEntity.setItemInHand` does (the main hand's or the off hand's slot, written as `set_equipment` writes it). Mobs store all eight slots (`Mob::equipment_stacks` reads them as a `horizon_items::equipment::Equipment`); players (the host and guests) hold an `Equipment` for body and saddle beside their own hand and armor fields, and save through its `read` / `write`. A player's
  `body` and `saddle` are kept and saved in the `equipment` compound as vanilla does, and dropped on death, but nothing
  renders or sends them. Armor stands and the dragon hold all eight slots in the same `Equipment`, saved in `equipment`
  (omitted when empty). A stand keeps a body or saddle a mod writes (`setItemSlot` stores it; `ArmorStand.canUseSlot`
  only stops a player equipping it), and pops it with the rest, after the other six slots, when it breaks. A write to a
  stand or the dragon runs `LivingEntity.onEquipItem` like a mob's: the equip sound and the `equip` or `unequip` game
  event, unless the entity has not ticked yet or the item did not change. `living_equipment_change` hears all
  eight slots of a stand. `/item replace` keeps vanilla's predicate for a stand's or the dragon's chest, legs, feet, body
  and saddle (an empty stack, or an item made for that slot; a stand's `canUseSlot` refuses body and saddle), while
  `set_equipment` stays permissive. This is not full dragon equipment parity: the dragon keeps its equipment for mods and
  saves, and does not drop it on death (the death drops are built on `Mob`, which the dragon is not).
- `living.swing(host, hand, send_to_self)` (`LivingEntity.swing`) starts an arm swing, shortened by haste and lengthened
  by mining fatigue, unless one is under way and past its first half (it returns whether one started). The players around
  see it at the end of the tick, the swinger too with `send_to_self`; clients see a mob swing the hand asked for. Mobs and
  players work; armor stands and the dragon return false, and so does a player other than the acting one while another
  player acts.
- `living.arrow_count(host)` / `set_arrow_count` and `stinger_count` / `set_stinger_count` (`DATA_ARROW_COUNT_ID`,
  `DATA_STINGER_COUNT_ID`) read and set what is stuck in a player or a mob; the entity data carries it to the players
  around, so they see it. Armor stands and the dragon keep no such count (None, false). `set_arrow_removal_ticks` and
  `set_stinger_removal_ticks` set the ticks until the next one falls out (`removeArrowTime`, `removeStingerTime`; at 0 or
  less the timer restarts at `20 * (30 - count)`); a mob's timers run in its tick as a player's do.
- `living.item_use_remaining(host)` / `set_item_use_remaining(host, ticks)` (`useItemRemaining`) read and move the end of
  the item a player uses: at 1 the use completes on the next tick, at 0 or less it lasts until the player lets go, as in
  vanilla. It moves the deadline the use-item Tick hook moves, so shield, bow, trident, spear, instrument and bundle uses,
  which don't count it, ignore it, and a call inside that Tick hook is overwritten by the hook's result. Nothing in use reads 0 and refuses a write. A mob's use never runs out: its read is the item's use duration less the ticks its use counter has run, and a write moves that counter to where `ticks` are left, which the stabs of a spear and the draw of a bow follow. A piglin admiring gold and a drinking witch use no item, so they read 0 and refuse a write.
- `living.set_riptiding(host, ticks, damage)` (`startAutoSpinAttack`) starts a player's Riptide spin: for `ticks` ticks
  the player turns, the first mob its box touches takes `damage` and ends the spin, and the players around see it
  (living flag 4). It adds no velocity (a Riptide launch does that itself), and a `ticks` of 0 or less ends the spin.
  Mobs, armor stands and the dragon return false: Horizon runs no spin for them.
- `living.set_waypoint_style(host, &style)` and `set_waypoint_color(host, rgb)` (`Waypoint.Icon.style`, `.color`) change
  the locator bar icon of a living entity as `/waypoint modify` does, untracking and tracking its waypoint again, so the
  players it transmits to get the new icon. A colour of `None` shows a player in their team's colour. Only a player's
  waypoint reaches other players (`waypoint_transmit_range` is 0 for every other entity); a mob's or an armor stand's
  icon is kept for its waypoint and `/waypoint list`. The dragon returns false.
- `living.used_item_hand(host)` (`getUsedItemHand` while `isUsingItem`) reads the hand of the item a player or a mob uses,
  None when it uses none; on a client only the local player answers. `living.start_using_item(host, hand)` is
  `LivingEntity.startUsingItem`: the item's use timer and the use-item Start hook, not the item's own `use` (no ammo check,
  no sound). A player's client lets go of a use whose button isn't down, as in vanilla, so that use is released on its next
  tick. `living.release_using_item(host)` is `releaseUsingItem`, what letting go of the button runs: the use-item Stop
  hook, the item's own release (a player's bow or trident shoots), a mod's `release_using`, once. A mob's use is its goal's
  counter: it shows and its goals see it, but it never runs out, so only a release or a goal ends it, and vanilla's bow and
  trident have no release for a mob. A piglin with something in its off hand and a drinking witch refuse a start and have no
  use to read or release: the counter is their own timer.
- `living.effects(host)` lists a living entity's active effects (vanilla's `activeEffects`) as `ActiveEffect`s — the
  load-owned `EffectKey` (read its canonical name with `key.id(host)`), the ticks left (-1 infinite), the amplifier, and the `ambient`, `visible` and `show_icon` flags
  (`show_icon` is vanilla's `showIcon`, apart from the particles). `living.effect(host, key)` reads one (`getEffect`) and `living.potion_affected(host,
  key)` answers `hasEffect`; request the key once through `Registrar::effect_key`. `living.add_effect(host, &effect)` is
  `LivingEntity.addEffect` by the game's own path: a player's or a guest's goes through the potion machinery (its attribute
  modifiers, absorption, and the added-effect hooks for a content mod's effect), a mob's past `canBeAffected` (a spider
  shrugs off poison) and with the same hooks. It returns true when accepted — whether it replaced one already there or only
  extended it is `MobEffectInstance.update`'s business (a stronger one replaces with its own duration, an equal one extends,
  a weaker one changes nothing). `living.remove_effect(host, key)` and `living.remove_all_effects(host)` take effects away
  the way their running out does: the attribute modifiers they gave recompute and absorption's hearts go with theirs. The
  added-effect hooks hear a player's add without an entity id, so a guest's reaches them as the acting player (`None`) — a
  limitation of the hooks themselves, unchanged here. Armor stands and the dragon keep no effects, as `/effect` skips them:
  `effects` and `effect` read `None` for them and their writes return false. On a client,
  `living.effect_blend_factor(host, key, partial)` (`getEffectBlendFactor`) reads how far the local player's effect has
  faded in at the partial tick: darkness fades over 22 ticks and nausea in over 150 and out over 20. Other effects start
  at 0 after a blended addition and interpolate to their post-countdown target each client tick (1 while active, 0 once
  expired). An unblended addition starts at its target immediately; a replacement packet preserves the old blend.
  Partial ticks are not clamped. A missing effect reads 0. The client keeps no other entity's effects, so they read `None`.
- `host.fishing_hook(entity)` gives a `FishingHookRef` for a cast hook (`FishingHook`); `hook.entity()` goes back.
  `player_owner(host)` is the player who cast it, `hooked_in(host)` what it holds (None when nothing, or when that is
  gone) and `open_water(host)` is `isOpenWaterFishing`. `item_fished` exposes mutable catch drops, cancel and absolute rod damage, names a hook by id, and `LevelRef::entities_in`
  finds them. Discarding one takes it out. It is not a `ProjectileRef`, and selectors do not find it yet.
- `host.projectile(entity)` gives a `ProjectileRef` for a projectile in the level's projectile list (arrows, a mob's
  trident, thrown items, fireballs, wind charges, skulls, shulker bullets, mods' thrown types), a trident a player
  threw or a firework rocket; `projectile.entity()` goes back. A player's trident and a rocket have an owner and a
  deflection only: `pickup`, `base_damage` and `critical` read None and their setters return false, and a player's
  trident always has a player owner (`set_owner` or `deflect` with none or a mob returns false). `owner(host)` resolves the owner to a current `EntityRef` (None when gone
  or in another level) and `set_owner(host, owner)` takes any entity but a fishing hook (`Projectile.setOwner`). An owner that is neither a
  player nor a mob is kept by its UUID: `owner` resolves it and a save keeps it, but a hit credits no one for it. `deflect(host, deflection, by, new_owner, by_attack, power)` is `Projectile.deflect`: `Deflection::Reverse`
  draws one float for the turn from the projectile's own random (`Entity.random`, never the level's), `AimDeflect`
  and `MomentumDeflect` use the look or the known speed (last tick's move, `Entity.getKnownSpeed`) of `by` and do
  nothing without it; the new owner is set and a fireball's or wind charge's acceleration power becomes 0.1 by an
  attack, else halves. A wind charge refuses for its first five ticks (`WindCharge.noDeflectTicks`): false, with no
  change and no draw. `set_owner` on an arrow also allows pickup for a player owner (`AbstractArrow.setOwner`);
  `deflect` does not (vanilla's `EntityReference` overload). Arrows (and a mob's trident for
  `pickup`) also have `pickup`/`set_pickup` (`ArrowPickup`), `base_damage`/`set_base_damage` and
  `critical`/`set_critical` and `pierce_level`/`set_pierce_level`. The pierce level is a signed byte:
  vanilla stores all values from -128 through 127 unchanged, and nonpositive values do not pierce. The
  typed result distinguishes a stale handle, a non-arrow projectile and a wrong-side host. The critical
  flag reaches clients through entity data; these handle methods operate on the server.
- `living.drop(host, stack, throw_randomly, include_thrower_name)` throws a stack the mod holds from the eyes
  (`LivingEntity.drop`) and gives the item entity; it never touches a slot. `is_tamed(host)` and `owner(host)` read a
  tamable mob or a horse (`TamableAnimal.isTame`, its owner's UUID).
- `entity.velocity(host)` (a player's is the move its client last reported), `set_velocity(host, v)` (not for players,
  whose client moves them), `on_ground`, `bounding_box` (lowest and highest corner), `eye_height`, `eye_position`,
  `view_vector` and `distance_to_sqr(host, pos)` read and move it.
- `entity.up_vector(host)` is `Entity.getUpVector`, the view vector turned toward the zenith. `on_block(host)` is
  `Entity.getOnPos`: the supporting block of an entity on the ground (the solid block under its box nearest it),
  else the block under its feet. `pick(host, distance)` clips `Entity.pick`'s ray from the eyes along the view
  against block outlines, no fluids, and returns the `ClipHit` (its `miss` set for a miss); entities are
  `ray_trace_entities`' job. `is_multipart(host)` and `parts(host)` are `Entity.isMultipartEntity` and `getParts`:
  the ender dragon's eight `EnderDragonPart`s (not the Parts of this API), head, neck, body, three tail segments and
  two wings, each an `EntityRef` of its own entity id, resolved as any handle is. A part's `kind` is the dragon's, its position, rotation (none: zero), velocity (zero)
  and `bounding_box` are its own, `level` is the dragon's, and it is no living entity, mob or dragon handle; it
  stops resolving when its dragon does, and removing one is refused.
- `entity.nbt(host)` and `merge_nbt(host, compound)` read and change its data as `/data get` and `/data merge entity`
  do (merging works on mobs, dropped items, armor stands and item frames; never on players, as in vanilla);
  `tags`, `add_tag`, `remove_tag` work as `/tag` does, and `name` is its name as plain text.
  `set_custom_name(host, Some(text))` names it and `None` takes the name away (`Entity.setCustomName`);
  `custom_name_visible` and `set_custom_name_visible` read and change whether the name shows at any distance. Both
  writes are saved and reach the players tracking a mob or an armor stand; they return false for a player and for the
  kinds whose name Horizon does not retain (projectiles, primed TNT, falling blocks, experience orbs, ominous item
  spawners, the dragon and crystals).
  `classification` is the type's `MobCategory`, and `added_to_level` is true from when `entity_join_level` let the
  entity in until it leaves or is removed.
- `entity.play_sound(host, sound, volume, pitch)` (`Entity.playSound`: at the entity, under its `sound_source`, for the
  players in range; a silent mob plays nothing and a player doesn't hear their own), `game_event(host, event)`
  (`Entity.gameEvent`: the entity is the source of a vibration for sculk sensors, wardens and allays),
  `broadcast_event(host, id)` (`Level.broadcastEntityEvent`: entity event `id` to the players tracking it and to
  itself, for `handleEntityEvent` to act on), `sound_source(host)` (`Entity.getSoundSource`, a `SoundSource`) and
  `spectator(host)` (`Entity.isSpectator`) work for every kind. `game_event` and `broadcast_event` act on the level in
  place and return false for a player in a parked level. There is no `sprint_particles`: vanilla spawns those on the
  client only.
- `player.stop_sound(host, sound, source)` sends `StopSoundCommand`'s packet to that player (`None` for any sound or
  source), `player.play_sound(host, sound, source, volume, pitch)` plays a sound for them only at their position, and
  `entity.play_bound_sound(host, sound, source, volume, pitch)` plays one that follows the entity for the players in
  range, as `Level.playSound(null, entity, ...)` does. `/stopsound` and `/playsound` send through the same code. They
  return false for a stale handle or a player who isn't online. Looping, fading and a handle to a playing sound need
  client handles.
- `living.health(host)` is `LivingEntity.getHealth` (Paper's `Damageable#getHealth`), `max_health` is
  `getMaxHealth` (players and guests read their attribute map; an armor stand the fixed 20 the game seeds it
  with — lava does not hurt it, and splash water reads the very field — and the dragon its 200, from their own
  fields until live attribute maps cover them) and `alive` is `isAlive`
  (Paper's `Entity#isDead` is its inverse; a dying mob, mid death animation, is not alive). During a nested
  player swap an outer player's displaced record is unavailable, and during a player's turn the other
  players' handles read `None` until the hub is back.
- `living.attribute_value(host, id)` is `AttributeMap.getValue` and `attribute_base` is `getBaseValue`, for a
  player, a guest, a mob, an armor stand and the dragon (`None` for an attribute the entity type lacks or a stale
  handle). A mob, a stand and the dragon answer from a live attribute map built from the type's
  defaults, the saved `attributes` list (bases and permanent modifiers, with their ids), and the attribute modifiers
  of the items they hold and wear, put on and taken off slot by slot in `EquipmentSlot` order as
  `LivingEntity.collectEquipmentChanges` does (transient: never saved). The map is built when first needed. Mob
  behavior still reads the type's defaults, so a modifier does not yet change how a mob moves or hits. An item's
  modifiers are the stack's own `attribute_modifiers` component or its item type's, as `item_attribute_modifier`
  leaves them. On a client the reads answer for the local player only, from the client's own copy of the synced
  instances (`ClientboundUpdateAttributes`, the type's defaults before the server sends any); every other entity
  reads `None` there, the client keeping no attribute map of another entity's, only the few fields it draws
  (`handleUpdateAttributes` for a mob extracts its maximum health and scale for the renderer).
- `living.attributes(host)` lists the ids of the attributes the entity's type has (the holder's attribute set the
  value and base reads answer from), in registry order. `living.attribute_modifiers(host, id)` is
  `AttributeInstance.getModifiers`: the attribute's modifiers in the order they were added — a mod's transient and
  permanent ones, the saved list's, and what the worn and held items grant. An attribute no modifier is on answers
  an empty list; `None` for an attribute the entity type lacks, a stale handle, or on a client for any entity but
  the local player. Diverges from upstream: new helpers.
- The writes take players, guests (in their own turn), mobs and armor stands, and answer false for an attribute the
  type lacks, the dragon (`/attribute` refuses it, and nothing reads its attributes yet), a stale handle, or on a
  client. `living.add_attribute_modifier(host, id, modifier, lifetime)` is `AttributeInstance.addTransientModifier`
  or `addPermanentModifier` (`ModifierLifetime`), refused when the attribute already has a modifier with that id
  (vanilla throws) or the amount is not finite. `replace_attribute_modifier` puts the new one in place of the old
  (`addOrUpdateTransientModifier`, `addOrReplacePermanentModifier`), and the new lifetime wins.
  `remove_attribute_modifier(host, id, modifier_id)` is `removeModifier` (false when there was none), and
  `set_attribute_base(host, id, base)` is `setBaseValue`. `AttributeModifier` holds the modifier's id, amount and
  `AttributeOperation`. A permanent modifier and a base are saved with the entity; a transient modifier lasts until it
  unloads. The writes take the one path `/attribute` takes, so they go where the game and the attribute sync read:
  - a player's own attribute map;
  - for a mob, the store of the nine attributes its behavior uses (max health, movement and flying speed, follow
    range, attack damage, knockback resistance, jump strength, burning time, reinforcements), so it moves and hits by
    them at once; its armor map for armor and toughness, which its damage reads; and for its other attributes, as
    for an armor stand, the generic map `/attribute` reads and the sync sends.

  The live map behind `attribute_value` takes the same write, so the reads agree with `/attribute`, and the entity's
  save keeps it. A lower max health cuts a mob's health (`LivingEntity.onAttributeUpdated`).
- `item_attribute_modifier` (`ItemAttributeModifierEvent`) edits what one stack grants: `ItemAttributeModifiers`
  holds `ItemAttributeModifier` entries (the attribute's id, an `AttributeModifier`, an `EquipmentSlotGroup`) and
  edits them as NeoForge's event does: `add` (`addModifier`, refused when the attribute has that id already),
  `replace`, `remove`, `retain` (`removeIf`), `remove_all_for` and `clear`. Every reader of a stack's modifiers asks
  through one place (`horizon_client::item_attributes`):
  - the equipment of a player, a mob, an armor stand and the dragon, when it changes;
  - mobs' gear knockback resistance and their pickup choices;
  - the attribute sync;
  - both tooltips.

  A worn stack is asked again only when it changes (`ItemStack.matches`), so the answer must be the same for the
  same stack. With no mod listening, or none changing a stack's list, nothing is copied. A player's attack speed
  still reads its held item type's `attack_speed`, not the stack's (see #549).
- `get_enchantment_level` (`GetEnchantmentLevelEvent`) edits the enchantments gameplay sees on a stack:
  `ItemEnchantments` is NeoForge's `ItemEnchantments.Mutable` (`level`, `set`, `upgrade`, `retain` for `removeIf`,
  levels at most 255), and `target` is the one enchantment a read asks for, `None` when every one is read. The
  game's reads follow NeoForge's split:
  - through the hook: `ItemStack::enchantment_level` (`getEnchantmentLevel`, every gameplay level read: Looting,
    Fortune and the other loot functions, Respiration, Silk Touch, Mending, Thorns, the trident's and crossbow's
    enchantments, fishing), and `ItemStack::all_enchantments` (`getAllEnchantments`: every enchantment effect
    component, the enchantments' attribute modifiers, the decorated pot's `hasTag` check, the killer's gear for
    entity loot);
  - the stack's own component: `ItemStack::enchantments` and `tag_enchantment_level` (`getTagEnchantmentLevel`)
    for tooltips, the anvil, grindstone and enchanting table, item predicates, saves, the network, and
    `EnchantmentHelper.has` (Curse of Binding), which this hook doesn't change.

  It is asked on every such read, many times a tick, so keep a listener cheap. With no mod listening nothing runs;
  with one, ids are parsed once and a read the mods leave alone allocates nothing.
- `living.set_health(host, health)` is `LivingEntity.setHealth` (Paper's `Damageable#setHealth`), cut to the
  range from zero to the maximum, with no hook; a non-finite value is refused. This raw write can set zero
  or change a dead entity's health without running the death pipeline.
  `living.heal(host, amount)` is `LivingEntity.heal`, through the `living_heal` hook: a signed amount changes
  health only when current health is above zero. Both write players, guests
  (in their own turn) and mobs, and answer false for armor stands and the dragon.
  `living.last_attacker(host)` is `LivingEntity.getLastHurtByMob`: who last hurt the entity, within a hundred
  ticks of the hurt, as an `EntityRef` of the current open; `None` once the window has passed or the attacker
  is gone, and for armor stands, the dragon and clients.
  `living.kill_credit(host)` is `LivingEntity.getKillCredit`: it returns the remembered player first, or the
  last hurting mob if there is no remembered player. A remembered player that cannot be resolved gives `None`,
  not the mob. Player credit resolves across dimensions; the mob fallback currently resolves only in the
  victim's level.
- An `EntityRef` holds the world's open (`WorldEpoch`) and the entity's id, which no other entity of that open
  gets. A handle of an earlier open, of an entity that is gone or moved to another level (it gets a new id there, as in
  vanilla), or used on a client reads as `None`.
- The entities are those of the level in place (the one a hook runs in) and the server's players, whatever their level.
- `host.block_entity(level, pos)` finds a block entity in a loaded chunk, including in parked levels;
  `kind`, `position`, `level` and `data` read it. A removed or temporarily taken-out entity reads `None`;
  a replacement at the same position resolves to the new entity, unlike vanilla's object identity.
- `player.open_menu(host, block_entity)` opens its menu on the server and returns true only when opened. It returns
  false for stale or wrong-level handles, non-providers, cancelled opens, and players without a connection (including
  fake players), since no connection can receive the menu.
- `block_entity.viewers(host)` lists the players with its container open on the server, read from their open menus
  when called: players in its level, not spectators or fake players, a double chest's menu on both halves. `None` for
  a stale handle or a client.
- `level.block_shape(host, state, pos, kind)` reads a supplied state's block-local outline or collision boxes with an empty context, without changing the world's state; pass `level.block_state(host, pos)` for the stored state.
  `None` for a client, unknown state, stale handle or closed level; parked levels can be read.
- `level.entities_in(host, min, max)` lists resolvable entities whose boxes intersect the given box in the active server level or the client's displayed level (other client players are omitted; arismoko/horizon#3033); see its method documentation for the kinds and tick-time visibility not yet covered.
- `level.pop_resource(host, pos, stack)` drops a stack as a broken block does (`Block.popResource`), `spawn_item(host, x, y, z,
  stack, pickup_delay)` and `spawn_item_with_motion` spawn a plain item entity and give its handle, with the pickup delay
  vanilla's `ItemEntity.setPickupDelay` sets at construction (10 a block's drop, 40 a player's throw, 32767 never), and
  `award_experience(host, x, y, z,
  amount)` splits experience into orbs (`ExperienceOrb.award`), all in the level in place.

`level.set_block(host, pos, state, flags)` and `level.remove_block(host, pos, moved)` change the level in place. They return false for a stale handle, client, parked level, unloaded chunk or out-of-height position; parked writes wait for a safe level swap. Removal preserves the fluid's legacy block; `moved` marks a piston move. `BlockUpdateFlags` combines supported vanilla update flags with `|`. `CLIENTS` sends the update, while `INVISIBLE` suppresses notification only on the client, as in `Level.setBlock`. Skipping block-entity side effects suppresses container-content drops when replacing a chest; without it, the contents spill.

`level.destroy_block(host, pos, drop, tool, collect)` uses that same level's destruction and loot path.
`tool: None` means an empty hand. With `collect`, the returned stacks are not spawned as item entities;
without it, a successful break returns an empty list after spawning them. The normal block-drop hook
still runs once before either outcome; tool enchantments and vanilla random ordering are unchanged.
`drop: false` suppresses resources. `None` means nothing broke, including an invalid write or air.
`level.set_break_progress(host, breaker, pos, stage)` shows stages 0..9 or clears the crack otherwise;
a machine uses a stable negative breaker id.

A helper whose catalog entry names a `receiver` (`entity`, `level`, `block_entity`) is called on that handle (for example `entity.position(host)`), rather than as an ID-based `Host` method.

### Client menu input

Client input uses `menu.click(host, &[mod_api::MenuClick::QuickMove { slot }])` on a mutable `ClientHost`.
Actions use menu-order slots; only `Pickup` accepts `None` for outside. Typed `MouseButton`,
`SwapWith` and `DragKind` values replace vanilla's wire codes, and `Drag { kind, slots }` expands
to a complete gesture. All actions are validated before the first is predicted or sent through the
normal `ContainerClick` path. A stale handle, invalid slot/hotbar index, creative-only action in survival,
spectator, non-client host or creative inventory screen returns `false` without side effects.
`true` is submission, not server acceptance; authoritative slot/cursor corrections still win.
`menu.close(host)` closes the menu's open screen as Escape does (`AbstractContainerScreen.onClose`,
`LocalPlayer.closeContainer`, which sends `ServerboundContainerClosePacket`), and `menu.click_button(host, button)`
sends `ServerboundContainerButtonClickPacket`. Both return `false` for a stale handle or a non-client host; `close` also
while the menu's screen is not open, and `click_button` for the inventory menu.
See [A menu's slots](../concepts/capabilities/menu-slots.md) for actions and an example.
Diverges from upstream: new helpers.

### Mob AI goals

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_mob_goals.rs` (#29's "movement and goals"): a mob's AI is vanilla's two goal
selectors, and a `MobRef` reads and changes them. `mob.goals(host)` and `mob.target_goals(host)` list each selector's
goals as a `MobGoalEntry` — the priority (a lower number preempts a higher one), the kind id (`melee_attack`) and
whether the goal runs now. `mob.add_goal(host, priority, &goal)` is `GoalSelector.addGoal`: the `GoalSpec` names one of
the vanilla goal kinds Horizon itself runs, with the vanilla constructor's parameters
(`MeleeAttackGoal(speed, followUnseen)`), and `mob.add_target_goal(host, priority, &goal)` adds to the target selector.
`mob.remove_goal(host, id)` and `mob.remove_target_goal(host, id)` are `removeGoal`: every goal of that kind goes, a
running one stopped first, and the count comes back; as vanilla's `removeAllGoals` with a `getClass()` predicate, a
species variant of a vanilla goal (a bee's `BeeHurtByOtherGoal`, a labeled stroll) keeps its own name, is read under it
and is removed by it.

The kinds, by their id: `float`, `climb_on_top_of_powder_snow`, `panic` (with `water_range` for the turtle's),
`stroll` (`water_avoiding`, `swim` and `flying` pick RandomStroll's variants), `look_at_player`, `random_look_around`,
`melee_attack`, `leap_at_target`, `avoid_entity`, `tempt` (item ids, `minecraft:wheat`), `breed`, `follow_parent`,
`follow_mob`, `restrict_sun`, `flee_sun`, `eat_block`, `breath_air`, `try_find_water`, and the target selector's
`nearest_target` (with `prey` and `interval`) and `hurt_by_target` (with `alert`). Species ids in `prey`, `what` and
`only` are namespaced (`minecraft:zombie`); a bare id reads as `minecraft:`'s.

An add refuses what the mob's vanilla class does not hold: a `PathfinderMob` goal for a bat, ghast or phantom,
and `breed` / `follow_parent` for a mob that is no animal. Slimes, magma cubes and shulkers are `PathfinderMob`s.
`follow_mob` accepts ground or flying navigation, but not water-bound or amphibious navigation. It also refuses
non-finite numbers, negative speeds and distances, a probability outside 0..=1, a
negative interval, an empty `items` list, and a species id no mob type carries. Reads and removes answer `None`/`false`
for a stale handle, a client, the dragon, and a mob whose copy is held out — nothing in a mob's own tick resolves, as
`Host` is not there yet: change goals in `entity_join`, which fires for a loaded chunk's mobs too. Goals are not saved,
as in vanilla: after a reload the mob has its species' set again, and a mod's `entity_join` adds its own back.

These methods reuse built-in goal kinds; they do not define arbitrary goal callbacks or run at construction's
`Mob.registerGoals` moment. [Custom mob goals at construction](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/1077)
tracks a typed goal registrar and callbacks on `MobRef` and Parts, shared by native and wasm mods. NeoForge has
no bus event at this moment. The upstream raw-`Mob` `register_goals` interface is not part of this fork's API.

### Mob AI controls

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_mob_refs.rs` and `native_mob_navigation.rs` (#938's mob AI controls): a `MobRef`
steers a mob through the engine's own controls, each a momentary wish the mob's own AI may replace next tick, as
`move_to`'s path is. Reads take the host by `&dyn Host` and writes by `&mut dyn ServerHost`.

- `mob.look_at(host, [x, y, z])` is `LookControl.setLookAt`: the mob's look control rotates its head toward the position
  over the next ticks. Non-finite coordinates are refused. `mob.jump(host)` is `JumpControl.jump`: the mob jumps on its
  next own tick by its own jump path — no velocity is written. No species refuses either: vanilla's brains themselves
  write through these controls (a brain species' `LookAtTargetSink` calls the same `lookAt`), so a mod's wish and the
  mob's own are one flag, not a brain memory a write could miss (which is why `set_target` refuses brain species, and `set_brain_target` writes their `ATTACK_TARGET` memory instead). A
  creaking being looked at, an angry bee and an axolotl playing dead hold their look control, and a held creaking its
  jump control, as in vanilla: the wish waits until the control runs again.
- `mob.navigation_speed(host)` / `set_navigation_speed(host, speed)` read and set `PathNavigation.speedModifier`, the
  multiplier the current path is followed at (1.0 is the mob's normal speed; 0 until a path sets one) — not the mob's
  movement-speed attribute. `move_to`'s speed argument sets the same modifier, and the mob's own next `moveTo` (a goal's
  or a brain species') sets its own again, as in vanilla. Non-finite speeds are refused.
- `mob.restrict_to(host, [x, y, z], radius)` is `Mob.restrictTo(pos, radius)`: the home area the mob keeps to — its own
  stroll and wander goals pick their positions inside it, as a lead's and a guardian's home do. It is saved with the mob
  (`home_pos`, `home_radius`). `restrict_center(host)` (`getRestrictCenter`; the last live one after a clear, `[0, 0, 0]`
  for a mob that never had one), `restrict_radius(host)` (`getRestrictRadius`; `-1` without a restriction),
  `has_restriction(host)` (`hasRestriction`), `clear_restriction(host)` (`clearRestriction`; the center stays) and
  `is_within_restriction(host, pos)` (`isWithinRestriction`; true everywhere without a restriction) read and change it.
  Radius `-1` in `restrict_to` clears the restriction while keeping the position as the center.
- `mob.left_handed(host)` / `set_left_handed` (`Mob.setLeftHanded`, the mob flags in its entity data, saved as
  `LeftHanded`) and `can_pick_up_loot` / `set_can_pick_up_loot` (`Mob.setCanPickUpLoot`, saved as `CanPickUpLoot`;
  an allay and a sulfur cube decide for themselves) moved here from the flat `living_*` helpers of #938's first round:
  vanilla keeps both on `Mob`, so `MobRef` is their home. The flat helpers are gone, with no aliases.
- All of these answer `None`/`false` for a stale handle, a client, the dragon (no `Mob` state), and a mob whose copy is
  held out of the level.

### Mobs drawn by a mod

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_mob_draw.rs`: `render_living_pre(entity, draw, hidden, canceled)` (client) is asked
once a frame for every mob and player in view, before its model (NeoForge's `RenderLivingEvent.Pre`). Set `canceled` and nothing
more of it draws this frame: model, layers, name tag, shadow, flames, leash, outline and `render_living_post`.

- `entity` (`MobRender`) is the frame's `LivingEntityRenderState`: the id, kind, custom name and `baby`, the partial tick,
  `age` (ticks lived plus the partial tick), `body_yaw`, `head_yaw` (from the body) and `pitch` in degrees, the walk cycle
  (`walk_position`, `walk_speed`: a vanilla quadruped's legs swing `cos(walk_position * 0.6662) * 1.4 * walk_speed` radians), `hurt_time`,
  `death_time` and `on_ground`.
- `draw` is a block entity's frame (`block_entity_submit`): draw with `native_draw_cube`, `native_draw_quad`,
  `native_draw_block` and `native_draw_item` under its pose stack, which starts at the mob's feet turned with its body: +z
  is the way it faces, +x its left, +y up, in blocks. Turn a head or swing a leg with `rotate_about` and a pivot. It holds
  the mob's light.
- A mod's own creature is an ordinary mob (`native_spawn_mob`) drawn this way: a quiet villager, an allay or a bat
  gives it movement, sounds and saving, and the mod gives it a model and animations of its own. Tell yours apart by the
  ids the server half sends with mod messages, or by its custom name.
- Players have an outer pair: `render_player_pre(player, who, draw, hidden, canceled)` (`RenderPlayerEvent.Pre`) before the
  living pre, and `render_player_post(player, who, parts, draw)` after the living post, once a frame for each other player in
  view and for this window's player in third person, with the same frame and `who` (the profile name, and `local`). A
  canceled player pre skips all four; canceling only the living pre still asks `render_player_post`.
- `render_living_post(entity, parts, draw)` (`RenderLivingEvent.Post`; a type's own layers are `register_entity_layers`)
  adds after the entity's model and layers, in the same frame. The geometry hangs from the entity's frame, not from a model
  bone: place a hat from `head_yaw`, `pitch` and the entity type's eye height.

### Advancement triggers

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_criteria.rs`: a mod's own criteria triggers, as a NeoForge mod registers a
`CriterionTrigger` and calls its `SimpleCriterionTrigger.trigger`. The advancement is an ordinary file of a content mod
or a world's data pack (`data/mymod/advancement/connect_a_pipe.json`) whose criterion names the mod's trigger and
whatever conditions the mod reads:

```json
{
  "criteria": {
    "copper_pipe": {
      "trigger": "mymod:pipe_connected",
      "conditions": {"pipe": {"items": "#c:ingots/copper"}}
    }
  }
}
```

- `player.trigger_criterion(host, &trigger, test)` fires it on a `PlayerRef`, with a mutable `ServerHost`,
  a mod-owned `Identifier` such as `mymod:pipe_connected`, and an `Arc<dyn CriterionTest>`. Each criterion with that
  trigger the player hasn't been granted, of an advancement not done yet, goes to `test`, then to its `player`
  predicate, as vanilla tests one. Those that pass are granted; an advancement they complete is awarded as by the game's
  own triggers: the toast, the chat line, the rewards and the player's saved progress.
- `CriterionTest::test(&self, criterion: &dyn CriterionContext)` returns `Result<bool, CriterionTestError>`.
  The context is a scoped game resource, borrowed only for this test; neither it nor its private world can be retained.
  `criterion.conditions_json()` gives owned JSON (`"null"` when conditions are absent).
  `criterion.item(key, &stack)` tests the item predicate under `key` as the game's own triggers read one: `items`
  (an id, a list or a `#tag`), `count`, the `potion_contents` and `damage` components, and the `enchantments` and
  `damage` predicates. Other components and predicates aren't checked. A missing key passes. Tag membership is
  evaluated in the target player's world, not from a detached conditions snapshot.
- It reaches the acting player inside their hook, and another player on the server in their own level, including
  during a guest's turn. A displaced outer player is unavailable. `Ok(())` means the player was reached, not that
  anything was granted. `TriggerCriterionError` distinguishes an invalid trigger (`minecraft:` is reserved; empty
  namespace/path is refused), a remote client, an unavailable player, a missing game backend, and a failed test.
  A failed test stops further tests; earlier matching criteria may already be granted. The test itself is not retained.
- Both resource interfaces and their glue are generated from the traits. Native and wasm predicates execute
  synchronously through the same criterion context. Wasm callbacks into the triggering group borrow the import's
  store while the outer call retains its group lock; fuel or epoch deadlines are shared, never refreshed for a
  callback, and the memory limit remains in force. The nested context expires on return and the outer call's frame
  is restored. A stopped or unavailable group returns `CriterionTestError::Unavailable`, propagated as
  `TriggerCriterionError::Test`, rather than silently treating the criterion as a nonmatch.

Diverges from upstream: this replaces the unscoped `Host` closure helper with a player receiver and generated
criterion resources; the private advancement world remains solely in the native implementation.

### Explosions

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_explosions.rs`: for server mods, in the level in place; the full contract,
with the causing-entity table, is the book's "Setting off an explosion" (how-to/world/block-experience-and-explosions.md).

- `LevelRef::explode(host, source, center, radius, fire, interaction)` is `Level.explode(source, ...)` in vanilla's order.
  The causing entity comes from `source`, never the caller: a primed TNT's owner, a living entity itself, a projectile's
  living owner, else none; with both the damage is `minecraft:player_explosion` and a kill credits the cause.
  `interaction` is `None`, `Block`, `Mob` (the source's `entity_mob_griefing`), `Tnt` or `Trigger` (no breaks; buttons,
  doors and the like react); `fire` works with any. False, doing nothing, for an unavailable level, a stale `source` or
  one in another level, an unloaded chunk, or a radius outside `0 < radius <= 32`.
- A blast set off inside `explosion_detonate` runs that hook again, so a mod that chains blasts keeps its own guard.

### Camera shake

`camera_shake(partial, shake)` (client) asks every frame for the camera shake a mod wants: `pitch`, `yaw` and `roll`
in degrees and an `offset` in blocks along the camera's right, up and back. Add to `shake` rather than set it, so two
mods' shakes add up. Horizon reads it only while playing, scales the sum by Distortion Effects (a player who turns
that to 0% sees no shake), bounds it to 10 degrees and half a block on each axis, and multiplies it into the view
after the hurt tilt and view bobbing. A mod keeps its own shake's time and decay, from `partial` and its tick hooks;
it moves only what the player sees, not where they are or aim.

### A player's motion

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_motion.rs`: a push on a client.

- `native_push_player([x, y, z])` (client) adds a push to the player's own velocity, in blocks a tick, as an
  explosion's knockback does: the player's own game moves them. The server didn't send it, so on a LAN or dedicated
  server the anticheat's movement check sees a move it can't explain (logged only unless the server sets it to send
  players back); for a push the server should stand behind, have the server send it. Each component is
  cut to 4 either way; an upward push lifts the player off the ground. A spectator, no player, or a value that isn't
  a number is left alone. A server mod that wants a client pushed sends its client half a message.

### Values for a mod's shader pack

`shader_params(partial, params)` (client) asks every frame, while a Horizon shader pack is on, for eight
`[f32; 4]` that every stage of the pack reads as `frame.mods` (`array<vec4<f32>, 8>`, docs/api/shaders-reference.md). What
they mean is the mod's own: a mod that bundles its pack as `native-<mod id>` writes the slots that pack reads, such as an
explosion's centre (camera-relative, from `frame.camera_position`) and its age in seconds, for a cloud or a shock wave
ray marched in a post pass against `scene_depth`. A value that isn't finite reads as 0, and all are 0 when no mod sets
them. The mod's server half can send what happened to each client half with mod messages.

### Biome colours

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/biome_colors.rs`: the grass, leaf and water colours a client mod changes while the
game runs, for seasons (a golden autumn, a pale winter) or a world that greens as it heals.

- `biome_colors(biome, colors)` (client) changes a biome's `BiomeColors`: `grass`, `foliage` (leaves, vines),
  `dry_foliage` (leaf litter) and `water`, 0xRRGGBB, starting from the biome file and the colormaps. The dark forest's
  modifier still darkens the grass set here; the swamp's noise colours replace it.
- It is asked for every biome when a mod calls `native_refresh_biome_colors()`. When the colours differ from those in use,
  every loaded section and the far terrain are rebuilt with them, as changing Biome Blend does. Call it when your colours
  change and once when the player joins, not every tick: a rebuild takes the workers a few seconds. A slow fade is a
  call a day, not a frame.
- Block-breaking and falling-leaf particles keep the biome's own colours.
- A season's mood in a shader pack (warmer grading, a lower sun, more haze) comes from the same mod through
  `shader_params` (`frame.mods`); its server half can send the season to each client with mod messages.

### Sounds a client mod plays

`ClientHost::play_local_sound(sound, after)` (client) plays `sound`, a `SoundPlay`, for this player only. Nothing is sent
to the server, and other players don't hear it. It takes `&self`, so the screen, key and mouse hooks, where interface
sounds belong, can call it: the sound is queued and starts at the next audio update (once a client tick), `after` ticks
counted from then (0 to 1200; `SoundEngine.playDelayed`). The answer is exact: the checks run at the call.
- `SoundPlay::ui(id)` is an interface sound (`SimpleSoundInstance.forUI`): at the listener, on the `Ui` source, not
  fading with distance, as the game's own button clicks play.
- `SoundPlay::at(id, source, position)` plays at a place in the client's level, fading with distance. A volume past 1
  carries farther, as vanilla's attenuation does.
- `with_volume`, `with_pitch` and `looping(delay)` (repeating, `delay` ticks between repeats: vanilla's
  `SoundInstance.getDelay`) change either.

It's the same record the `play_sound` hook edits, and it goes through the same mapping into the engine. The event is
vanilla's (`minecraft:entity.generic.explode`) or the mod's own: a content mod's `assets/<id>/sounds.json` and
`assets/<id>/sounds/*.ogg` load with the rest of its assets. A client half that hears from its server half (mod
messages) where something happened can time the sound to the distance, such as a blast heard when its shock wave reaches
the player: `after = distance / speed`. It answers `None` on a server and for a value out of range (an event id that
isn't namespaced, a position or volume that isn't finite, a negative volume, pitch or repeat gap, `after` past 1200);
an event the resources lack plays nothing. Diverges from upstream: horizon-rust/horizon's `native_play_local_sound` takes
`(sound, at, volume, pitch, delay)`.

Otherwise it answers a `SoundRef`, a handle on this one play, never reused. Its methods take the `&dyn ClientHost`, so
any client hook can call them. Like the play, the writes are queued for the next audio update, while the answers are
computed at the call:
- `sound.state(host)` is `Some(SoundState)`: `Waiting` (queued, waiting out `after`, or between a looping sound's
  repeats), `Playing` (`SoundEngine.isActive`) or `Stopped`. It is `None` on a server.
- `sound.stop(host)` stops it for good: a waiting sound never starts and a looping one never repeats. A stop asked
  since the last update already reads `Stopped`.
- `sound.fade(host, volume, ticks)` moves its volume to `volume` (at or above 0) in equal steps over the next `ticks`
  unpaused ticks it plays, or at once for 0. A fade to 0 stops it when the fade ends, as `LoopSoundInstance.fadeOut`
  does. A `SoundPlay` at volume 0 faded up fades in, and a later fade replaces one in progress. While the game is
  paused the fade waits, as vanilla's tickable sounds do (`SoundEngine.tick(paused)`): an interface or music sound
  keeps playing at the volume it had (`pauseAllExcept(MUSIC, UI)`), and any other sound pauses with the game.

`stop` and `fade` answer false, changing nothing, once the sound is over. Once it ends, is stopped or faded out, or is
cleared (leaving or changing levels stops every sound), the handle reads `Stopped` and its writes do nothing. It stays
valid across a change of output device, which reopens the output on the same mixer and keeps the sounds playing.
Dropping or overwriting the handle doesn't stop the sound: keep a looping sound's handle while it plays (stop it before
starting another in its place), or nothing can stop it until the player leaves the level.

`ClientHost::sound_events()` lists every sound event the client's resources have (`SoundManager.getAvailableSounds`).
`audio_devices()` lists the output devices by name (`SoundEngine.getAvailableSoundDevices`), and `audio_device()` names
the one the options ask for, empty for the system's default. Both lists are built anew at each call, and listing the
devices probes each one: ask from setup or a settings screen, not every frame.

### Falling blocks

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_falling.rs`: a helper for server mods, for the level in place, on a server only. It
names the level it means by its `dimension` (`minecraft:overworld`), as `native_set_block` does.

- `native_spawn_falling_block(dimension, state, pos, velocity, falling)` throws a falling block of `state` from `pos` (its
  bottom centre) at `velocity` in blocks a tick, each axis cut to 3.9. It flies, lands and places itself as sand does, or
  drops as an item where it can't be placed. `Falling` holds `drop_item` (default true) and `hurts` (hurts what it
  lands on as an anvil does, 2 a block fallen and 40 at most; default false).
- The block at `pos` stays: take it away first with `native_set_block` to make a block fall out of the world, as an
  explosion's debris or a collapsing tower would.
- It answers false, throwing nothing, on a client, for another dimension, air or an unknown state, a chunk that isn't
  loaded, a value that isn't finite, or with 1024 falling blocks in the level already.

### Bulk block edits

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_world_edit.rs`: a helper for server mods, for the level in place, on a server only.
It names the level it means by its `dimension` (`minecraft:overworld`), as `native_set_block` does.

- `native_edit_blocks(dimension, edit)` makes many blocks at once: `BlockEdit` holds a `palette` of block states and
  a list of typed `StatePredicate` filters (exact blocks or tags), and `runs`, each
  `height` blocks up column (`x`, `z`) from `y`, set to palette entry `block`, only where filter `only` passes the block
  there. With `surface` (`Heightmap`: `WorldSurface`, `MotionBlocking`, `MotionBlockingNoLeaves` or `OceanFloor`),
  `y` counts from that height of the column, read once a column before anything changes. Runs are made in order, each
  seeing the changes of those before it.
- The blocks go straight into the chunks, a section packed once however many of its blocks change, as `fill ... strict`
  does: no neighbour is told, nothing drops, and no block updates or ticks; light is worked out again for the chunks
  changed, and they go to the players whole. A block replaced by another loses its block entity, and a new block gets
  the one `native_set_block` would give it (a mod block's own, included).
- It answers the number of blocks changed. Runs in chunks that aren't loaded, and the parts of runs outside the level's
  height, are left out. It answers `Err`, changing nothing, on a client, for another dimension, a palette entry or filter
  or predicate that fails validation (NBT is not representable), a run naming a palette entry or filter past
  the end, or more than 65536 filters.

### Column reads

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_world_columns.rs`: helpers for server mods, for the level in place, on a server
only, that read many columns in one call. They name the level they mean by its `dimension` (`minecraft:overworld`), as
`native_set_block` does, and answer `Err` with the reason, reading nothing, on a client, for another dimension or for
a read too big, so a mod can tell "ask for less" from "wrong level". They run on the server tick: read a big area in
pieces.

- `native_surface_heights(dimension, columns, heightmap)` answers each column's height on `heightmap` (`Heightmap`,
  as `native_edit_blocks` reads it: one above the highest block that counts), `None` for a column whose chunk isn't
  loaded; at most 65,536 columns a call.
- `native_read_columns(dimension, columns, heightmap, (below, above))` reads, for each column, the blocks from `below`
  under its height to `above` - 1 over it, bottom first: `ColumnBlocks` holds the heights (`bases`), the block
  complete `BlockState` values seen (`palette`), the blocks as indexes into it, and three biome tints a column (grass,
  foliage and water, at the column's top). Blocks outside the level's height, and every block of a column not loaded,
  read as air (its tints as 0). `below + above` must be 1 to the level's height, and the read at most 1,048,576 blocks.
  The tints are the biome's own at the column's top, not blended over the biome blend radius as the game draws them, so
  near a biome border they can differ from what players see by a few blocks.

### Chat and commands a client mod sends

`ClientHost::send_chat(message)` sends what the player could type in chat, to any server, a vanilla one included:
`ClientPacketListener.sendChat` and `sendCommand`. A leading `/` sends the rest as a command, signed where its
arguments are messages; anything else goes as signed chat. The message is trimmed first, as the chat screen trims it.
It fires no `client_chat` (vanilla's `ClientChatEvent` comes only from the chat screen) and isn't added to the chat
history. It is an error when the player isn't in a server's play state (not connected, not joined yet or being
reconfigured), when the trimmed message is empty, and when the Chat option blocks it: Commands Only blocks chat,
Hidden blocks chat and commands. The server's own spam limits apply as they do to typed chat.

### Server menus

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_menus.rs`: menus a server mod builds from ordinary items, which a
stock client shows as a chest (`generic_9x1` to `generic_9x6`); nothing is installed on the player's side.

- `host.open_menu(uuid, rows, title, items, replace)` opens one in place of the player's open menu (its window id, a new one each time, as `ServerPlayer.openMenu` counts them); the old menu closes on the server as a close does, its cursor stack back to the inventory, and its window's packets are ignored. `MenuReplace::CloseFirst` first sends the client a close, vanilla's default; `MenuReplace::InPlace` doesn't (`MenuProvider.shouldTriggerClientSideContainerClosingOnOpen`), so the title and rows change without the mouse centring again. A title changes only this way. `host.close_menu(uuid)` closes it.
  `host.menu(uuid, window)` is the open one's `MenuRef` (None for another window or player): its slots are [menu slots](../concepts/capabilities/menu-slots.md), written in a transaction, and the tick's container sync sends each changed one (`ContainerSetSlot`). Change its items that way, not by opening it again.
- **No click moves anything.** Each reaches `menu_clicked(uuid, window, slot, button, mode)`, and the client
  is sent the menu, its inventory and its cursor as they were. `slot` counts the menu's own slots first, then the
  player's inventory below it: `native_menu_inventory_slot(size, slot)` gives the inventory slot (0..9 the hotbar).
- `menu_closed(uuid, window)`: the player closed it, another menu opened, or the player left.
- A trade on these menus leaves the offered stacks in their owners' inventories until both sides are settled. Then,
  in one `host.transaction`, each offered inventory index is checked to still hold exactly what was offered, taken
  out of the player's [`ENTITY_ITEMS`](../concepts/capabilities/entity-items.md) handler and put into the other's with `insert_any`
  ([the recipe](../concepts/capabilities/entity-items.md)). A changed offer or no room returns an error, and every move is put back.

### Render functions

`crates/horizon-mod-render/src/render.rs`: native-only, unstable raw frame places, outside `mod_api`.
A native mod replaces one with a `HEAD` mixin at `horizon_mod_render::render::<name>`. They run on the render thread with the frame's wgpu objects;
what a mod draws there shows in that frame. Draw contexts remain the API-typed drawing route.

- `world_drawn(world)`: the world is drawn (sky, terrain, entities, particles, weather and the world post pass),
  the first-person hand, the HUD and screens not yet. `WorldDrawn` holds the device, queue and encoder, the frame's
  colour target (copy it out before sampling it), the world's reversed depth and its size, the camera's position and
  its matrices with and without TAA's jitter, the frame's camera-relative entity quads with their runs by entity, the
  entity atlas, the shared quad index buffer and the block sprite arrays ([block textures](#block-textures)). Not
  called on the title screen's panorama. `motion` says which mob, player or dropped item each run of the entity quads
  is, by its entity id, so a mod can match an entity's vertices with last frame's (a motion blur's own motion
  vectors); `spans` only name the type.
- `hand_drawn(hand)`: the first-person hand and held item are drawn, after `world_drawn` and before
  entity outlines, post effects, screen effects and the HUD, on every frame `world_drawn` runs. `HandDrawn`
  holds the device, queue and encoder, the frame's colour target with the hand in it, the hand's camera-relative
  quads (empty when no hand drew: third person, F1, a shader pack's own hand), the hand's clip matrix (its own field
  of view and the view bob, no jitter), the camera, the entity atlas and the quad index buffer. The hand's depth isn't
  kept: draw its quads into a depth of your own. A motion blur can match the hand's quads with last frame's for the
  swing, attack, equip and bob motion, and blur the picture with the hand in it.
- `render_needs(needs)`: set `entity_spans` to have the entity geometry split into runs by entity without a
  shader pack (each run's id is stable from frame to frame: a hash of the entity type's name, a block entity's state),
  and `world_depth` to keep the world pass's depth when nothing else needs it. Set what you need and leave the rest:
  several mods can ask. It's asked as each frame is built, so keep it cheap.

### Block textures

`crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_block_sprites.rs` and `WorldDrawn::block_sprites`: for a client mod drawing
blocks in its own pass (flying debris as voxels, say) with the player's own block textures, resource packs included,
as the terrain samples them.

- `WorldDrawn::block_sprites` (`BlockSpriteArrays`) holds the block sprite arrays as `D2Array` views: the terrain's
  eight, a 1-layer stand-in past the ones in use, each with the mip levels the Mipmap Levels option leaves, animated
  layers at the frame shown. Each texture is a whole square layer of `size` texels, its UVs 0 to 1 across it,
  gamma-encoded as the world uses it. `split` layers go to an array (2048 on most GPUs, fewer where the GPU holds
  fewer): every vanilla texture is usually in array 0. `nearest` samples texels sharp (nearest, repeating, the
  nearest mip level), `filtered` is the terrain's own sampler.
- `native_block_sprites(blocks)` says, for each block (`minecraft:grass_block`, `oak_log[axis=x]`; properties left
  out take the default), what its model draws on each side, in `Direction` order (down, up, north, south, west,
  east): its faces in the order drawn, each with its `sprite` (`array`, `layer`, `animated`, `cutout`), its `rect`
  on the side and `inset` from the side's plane (a whole face is 0, 0, 1, 1 and 0), its `uv` map, its `tint` source
  and whether it is `translucent`; the model's `particle` sprite; whether it is a plain `cube`. None for a block the
  game doesn't know. A side's axes run along x then z for down and up, x then y for north and south, z then y for
  west and east, from the block's corner nearest 0, 0, 0 (`block_sprites::side_axes`); the point (a, b) of a side
  shows the sprite at `(uv[0], uv[1]) + a * (uv[2], uv[3]) + b * (uv[4], uv[5])`, rotations and mirrors included
  (for a plain block's north side, `u = 1 - x, v = 1 - y`). A tinted face is multiplied by its source's colour:
  `Grass`, `Foliage`, `DryFoliage` and `Water` are the biome's where the block is, `Fixed` a constant (spruce
  leaves, redstone at its power). A grass block's side is two faces, the side and then its grey overlay tinted with
  grass. The model is the state's first random variant; faces that don't lie flat on a side (a flower's crossed
  planes) are left out, and the `particle` sprite stands for them. Fluids give their still texture on every side.
- `native_texture_sprites(textures)`: a texture's sprite by name (`block/stone`), none for one no model uses.
- `native_gui_sprite(sprite)`: a GUI atlas sprite's `AtlasRegion` by `Identifier` (`minecraft:gui/sprites/container/slot`,
  `minecraft:particle/flame`, `mymod:gui/panel`), its UV rect and its size in its own pixels, none for one the atlas
  lacks. Plain data, right until the next `texture_atlas_stitched` for `TextureAtlas::Gui`.
- `native_block_sprites_version()` changes each time the resources load (a resource pack turned on or off moves the
  layers, and the arrays are new): ask again then.

Look blocks up once and keep what you need (a few words a block for your own shader), not every frame.

### Menu slot rules

`menu_slot_rules` asks the registered vanilla or mod menu's scoped `MenuPart` whether a slot takes a stack and how many it holds, on both client prediction and server. Mount inventories use `horizon:mount_inventory`; unregistered player inventory and creative picker menus do not dispatch. `slot` is the backing container index. The slot's own answers arrive first; the final maximum is clamped to 1–99 and the item's stack limit. Rules also apply to quick-move top-ups. The hook takes the read-only `Host` (it is a query: it cannot write or cancel). A click asks once for each slot and stack it consults while it plans the click, and its answers stay in what it planned: nothing asks again to validate or apply. On a LAN host's own click the game is lent to the click with the LAN host lifted out of it, so what the `Host` reads of LAN players answers as if no LAN were open.

The hook runs during clicks, drags and shift-clicks with the read-only `Host` on server and client prediction; answer from the stack and host alone, and fast. Parts that read `context.setting(..)` or `side()` have no counterpart on the Host. Named injections request `hook_version = 3`.

### Shift-click in a mod container

`menu_quick_move(pos, entity, container_slots, slot, stack, handled)` is a mod container's
`AbstractContainerMenu.quickMoveStack`, the method a Java menu overrides to say where a shift-clicked stack goes. It is
asked on the server before the game's own routing, for the mod block entity at `pos` whose menu a player shift-clicked
with the left or right button, on a vanilla menu type (`minecraft:generic_9x1`...) or on the mod's own menu type. `slot`
is the menu's index: below `container_slots` the block's own slot (`entity.items[slot]`), from there the player's
inventory, its 27 main slots, then the hotbar. `stack` is a copy of what that slot holds. Take what you move out of
`stack` (into `entity.items`, or into another block through its `ITEMS` capability) and set `handled`: the slot holds what
is left of `stack` (whatever you wrote to that slot of `entity.items`), the game's routing is skipped, and the player's
client gets the whole menu again. Unhandled, `entity.items` goes back to what it held and the game moves the stack as
for any container; a later mod sees what an earlier one did to `stack`. If the mod removes its own block, the menu
closes and the player's inventory is sent again. This is how a storage terminal
whose items live in other blocks, or a screen that hides the container's slots, takes a shift-click from the
inventory, and how a machine sends fuel to its fuel slot and ores to its input.

Not asked for an empty slot, a slot the mod's screen hides, another click type, a spectator or a dead player, a menu
no longer valid, or a shift-click during a drag (it only ends the drag, as in vanilla). It is asked once per click, where vanilla asks `quickMoveStack` again while the same item keeps moving: move
all you want in one call. The clicking player's state is swapped in (`host.players().acting_player` names them), and `entity`
is out of the world during the call, as in `menu_button`. Only a server's players (single player's server
thread, LAN guests, a dedicated server) shift-click this way; a native mod's own menus (`native_open_menu`) get their
clicks already.

### The loop context

`dyn LoopContext` is the read-only view for a hook fired inside a menu, recipe or
player-list loop, where no game is at hand (a catalog entry names it with
`"context": "loop"`; `player_name_format`,
`player_tab_list_name_format`, `living_jump_power`, `living_speed`, `living_flying_speed`, `living_heal`, `living_breathe`, `living_drown`, `living_fall`, `farmland_trample`, `living_jump`, `ender_entity_teleport`, `fluid_flow`, `player_stays_on_ground_surface`, `block_jump_factor`, `block_speed_factor`, `friction`, `ingredient_test` and the sound hooks below take it). `side()` is `LoopSide::Server` or
`LoopSide::Client`, `registry(name)` borrows names in registry ID order,
`setting(mod_id, key)` returns a loaded mod's setting captured when the context was
built, and `mods()` is the `LoadedMods` view of registration. It has no game Host,
handle construction or transaction, and its answers never change while it is held.
The side that owns the loop builds it, never a hook: the client builds one at window
start and again after each resource reload, and a server builds one when it starts its
mods and again on each `/reload`, so a reload captures fresh settings. A LAN or dedicated server's hub holds the server's
current one, so its Tab list and chat names, and the clicks of its players, see it too.

`item_stacked_on_other(host, event, result, canceled)` is NeoForge's `ItemStackedOnOtherEvent`, fired inside a pickup click on
either side with the game's `Host` and the click frozen in `event`; see its hook documentation. `player_name_format(context, username,
displayname)` and `player_tab_list_name_format(context, player, name, display_name)` format a player's name for chat and
commands (both sides) and for the Tab list (server). The name hooks are contract version `2`: a mod written for `1` takes the
context as a new first argument of the `Hooks` method, and reads the side from it instead of `event.side`.

`ingredient_test(context, kind, data, stack, accept)` is the match-time half of a mod's own ingredient kind: it runs when recipe matching tests a concrete stack against the kind, with `accept` already true. `context` is the loop context of the side that matches: the server's for the server's crafting grids, furnaces, stations and recipe tables, the client's for the client's own grid prediction, recipe book and ghost recipes. It fires inside recipe matching, so it takes no `Host` (a deferred call would reorder matching). Matching passes the context explicitly from the game or menu environment that holds it; there is no global. A mod reads an ingredient with `Ingredient::test(host, stack)` (`&dyn Host`, as handle reads do): the game answers with its own loop context, a mod never builds one, and the old `test(stack)` is gone. `Ingredient` is plain data. `ingredient` (load, `DataLoadContext`) and `ingredient_test` stay separate hooks and the load path is unchanged. Contract version `2`: a mod written for `1` takes the context as a new first argument of the `Hooks` method. With no listener the cost is one `listened` branch per test; the context is one pointer, with no allocation. Recipe matching tests every slot change on both sides (per tick for a furnace) and on each click.

### Sound hooks

Four client hooks take the `LoopContext` from the sound engine, which has no game at hand and plays sounds from its own loops:

- `play_sound` is `PlaySoundEvent`. It fires at the start of vanilla's `SoundEngine.play`, before the engine's own checks, for every sound the client plays. `original` is the sound as asked for and `sound` is `&mut Option<SoundPlay>`, a copy of it that later mods see edited: change its volume, pitch, source, position, identifier, looping, delay, attenuation or `relative`, or set it to `None` to play nothing. A changed identifier is resolved again, with its own weighted pick. Only the fields of `SoundPlay` carry over; the engine's random, ticking and resolved sound never leave it. Setting `None` is the mod's own answer (there is no constant): a sound nobody edits plays as before.
- `play_sound_source` is `PlaySoundSourceEvent` and `play_streaming_source` is `PlayStreamingSourceEvent`. A sound fires exactly one of them, after the engine started it on a channel: streamed sounds (music, records) the second, every other sound the first. They are notices, and `ChannelRef` is an id only: a mod cannot drive the channel. A mod that needs channel control names the mixin it replaces.
- `sound_engine_load` is `SoundEngineLoadEvent`. It fires when the output is open: at window start, after each resource reload (with the new generation's context) and when the output device changes. With no audio (no device, or `HORIZON_NO_AUDIO`) the engine never loads: this hook and the two source hooks do not fire, while `play_sound` still does, since it comes before the engine's check that it loaded.

All four early-out on the mod's subscription before building a `SoundPlay`, so a game with no listener pays one branch per play. They are client-side only: a server has no sound engine and builds no context.

### Items' default components

`Hooks::modify_default_components` receives `&dyn DataLoadContext` before its
`ModifyDefaultComponentsEvent`. The engine supplies this read-only phase context:
`origin()` is `DataLoadOrigin::ServerDataLoad` or `ClientPreload`, `registry(name)`
gives the names in registry ID order as a shared `Arc<[String]>` (no copy), `setting(mod_id, key)` returns a loaded mod's
setting captured when the owning context is built (including missing keys), and
`mods()` gives the same `LoadedMods` view used during registration (shared; cloning it
copies no package). A later owning
load captures fresh settings even when it reuses registry inputs; runtime Host
settings still read live storage. There is no game Host, handle construction or
transaction. The origin describes the actual owning load, not its thread name or
the side of a later reader. The raw-injection `hook_version` is `2`.

The lower firing target is `modify_default_components(context, item, components)`
in `crates/horizon-world/src/item_defaults.rs` (NeoForge's `ModifyDefaultComponentsEvent`).
`components` is the item's entry in `items.json`, vanilla's default-component report:
insert or replace a key to set a component (`"minecraft:max_stack_size": 16`), remove it to take the component away.
Any item can be changed, vanilla's included. Write values as vanilla's codec writes them: nothing decodes them with it.
Each table reads the fields it understands and takes a default for a field it can't read, but keeps the component, so a
malformed `minecraft:food` still makes the item edible, with no nutrition. A stack size above vanilla's 99 is kept: the
data pack's own is held to `ExtraCodecs.intRange(1, 99)`, a mod's to 1 to `i32::MAX` (the count the wire and the save
carry), and a value that is not a number leaves the data pack's own. Keep a stack above 99 to a server whose clients run
the mod: a vanilla client decodes the count with vanilla's 1 to 99 and cannot show it.

- One owning load decodes the defaults, asks once per item, then publishes one immutable snapshot. The item
  table, loot, enchanting, item models, banners, pot sherds and rarity readers borrow that snapshot; workers
  retain shared ownership. The renderers also share its canonical component prototypes. Stacks are saved and
  sent as their difference from the changed defaults, as from vanilla's.
- Reusing client-preloaded item data on the integrated server is not another load. Opening a world or running
  the data-pack `/reload` does not replay this hook. A dedicated resource load supplies `ServerDataLoad`;
  the client preload supplies `ClientPreload`. The hook may run on a load worker, before a game Host exists.
- Client and server each apply their own mods, so both need the mod. A client without it (a vanilla Java client, or
  Horizon without the mod) fills in vanilla's defaults for the same stacks: a stone stack the server caps at 16 still
  looks like it stacks to 64 there.
- The creative search tab matches vanilla's exported tooltip text, so a changed `item_name` is not searchable yet."##]
    #[notes = r#"## Counterparts

A hook's optional `neoforge` catalog key names its NeoForge 26.3 counterpart;
that counterpart sets the hook's name, side and cancellation contract. The optional
`fabric` and `paper` keys name Fabric and Paper events at the same moment with the
same contract. Each key is a string or a list of strings; omission is valid. One
hook serves each matching moment; near matches with different timing, side or
cancellation are gaps, not counterparts. A hook with none of these keys names the
mod mixin or use it replaces in its design or PR."#]
    #[notes = r#"## Left to do

- A list of every native build, to delete the ones no instance needs.
- A prebuilt horizon-mixins from its CI instead of building it on the player's computer."#]
    #[notes = r##"## More hook capabilities

- `entity_join_level(dimension, entity, kind, pos, loaded_from_disk, canceled)`, an entity joining a
  server level (NeoForge's `EntityJoinLevelEvent`, vanilla's `PersistentEntitySectionManager.addEntity`):
  `loaded_from_disk` is true when it comes back with its chunk, false for a fresh add (a drop, an orb, `/summon`, an
  arrival through a portal into another level). The entity is already in the level's lists when the hook runs; `canceled` takes it back
  out, and a `/summon` of it fails with vanilla's "duplicate UUIDs" message. It tells every kind in the game's entity
  lists (items, orbs, mobs, boats, minecarts, armor stands, primed TNT, falling blocks, projectiles, rockets, tridents),
  once each, in creation order, so check `kind`. A drop, an orb, a mob, a `/summon` and a chunk's entities are told at
  once; other gameplay spawns when the next tick starts, and a cancelled one is removed then.

- [A block's items](#a-blocks-items) are available to server mods through the item capability and
  `move_resources`, so a pipe or machine can move items transactionally.

- What a server mod needs for a public server's screens: `native_sidebar(uuid, sidebar)` shows one
  player a sidebar of up to 15 lines (a text, and one where the score would be) that only their client holds (the
  server's scoreboard never sees it; a mod sends it again when they rejoin), or takes it away with `None`;
  `player.tab_list(host, header, footer)` sets the lines over and under their Tab list; `native_tick_stats()` reads the
  server's tick rate and average tick time in ms (`/tick query`'s); and `player.set_sleep_ignored(host, ignored)` leaves a
  player out of `players_sleeping_percentage`'s count until they are in bed (players away from the keyboard). It refuses
  when the server list is unavailable. Read where they look through each handle's entity.

- Damage a mod can change or cancel through `native_living_incoming_damage` (NeoForge's
  `LivingIncomingDamageEvent`): where `LivingEntity.hurtServer` starts, once its guards passed (invulnerable, dead or
  dying, fire with fire resistance; Horizon's mobs don't check the fire resistance effect there yet), on every damage
  route, with the hit's level host (its blocks, random and own attachments), the hurt entity's id and type
  (`minecraft:player` for a player), the hit's source (`HurtSource`: the damage type, `minecraft:fall`; the causing
  entity, `causing`, vanilla's `DamageSource.getEntity`: a skeleton for its arrow; the direct entity, `direct`,
  `getDirectEntity`: the projectile's entity id when the damage type names one, for hits on players, mobs and
  the ender dragon, including an ownerless projectile, or the attacker itself in melee; `magic()` and any other
  source with no direct entity stay 0 even during that projectile's impact; and `position`, `getSourcePosition`), the `victim`'s
  position and view vector, the direct entity's `weapon` (`getWeaponItem`) when Horizon knows it (a player's or mob's
  melee hit inside its attack), and the hit's `DamageContainer` before any reduction. The entity ids are 0 for none,
  and for the sources listed below that Horizon doesn't track yet. A mod may change the container's new damage or the
  invulnerability ticks a fresh hit leaves (vanilla's 20), or set `canceled`: nothing of `hurtServer` itself happens
  then (no damage, hurt sound, knockback, invulnerable time, statistics or criteria), and the caller acts as on a
  refused hit, so a blast still pushes a mob whose hit was canceled, as vanilla pushes one that refused it. A canceled
  hit on the ender dragon still counts as landed, as vanilla's `EnderDragon.hurt` returns true whatever `reallyHurt`
  did: the arrow is spent and the melee effects run. A ghast's canceled hit by a fireball it was sent back counts as
  landed (`Ghast.hurtServer`). A negative amount hurts by 0 and a NaN or infinite one by `Float.MAX_VALUE`, as vanilla
  clamps them. It fires for the players, mobs and the ender dragon the game hurts, and runs on the thread that ticks
  the world (the server thread), so state a mod shares with its render thread hooks needs synchronising. `/kill` and
  `native_kill_mob` don't reach it yet: they set the health to 0 instead of hurting with `minecraft:generic_kill` as
  vanilla does. A mod may also register reduction modifiers on the container
  (`container.add_reduction_modifier(Reduction::Armor, ReductionChange::Scale(0.5))`, NeoForge's
  `addReductionModifier`): each changes what one reduction (the damage cooldown, armor, Resistance, protection
  enchantments, a witch's innate resistance, the absorption hearts) takes off this hit, in the order added, and
  the recorded reduction and the damage the sequence goes on with are the changed ones, kept between 0 and what
  there was to take. A step the hit skips (a source that bypasses armor, no Resistance effect) runs none. They
  last for the hit.

- `living_damage_post` (NeoForge's `LivingDamageEvent.Post`) observes every hit that passed `living_incoming_damage`
  and the cooldown, at the end of `hurtServer` (after a totem and the hurt sounds; the death hooks follow it,
  Horizon's order, not NeoForge's), even one that took no health (`container.health_damage()` 0). Its
  `container.should_cause_side_effects()` is `hurtServer`'s fresh-hit decision (`shouldCauseSideEffects`), taken
  before the damage: true for a fresh hit, false for a stronger hit inside the invulnerability window, and true for a
  source that bypasses the cooldown. The flag is not inferred from final damage or invulnerability ticks, so a damage
  listener changing those leaves it. Native and wasm listeners get it beside the reductions and damages; it describes
  the decision to cause fresh-hit effects, not whether every effect occurred.

A player's damage type is the source's own. A mob's and the dragon's come from the kind of damage Horizon keeps for
the hit, which doesn't tell every vanilla type apart yet:

- A trident's hit on a mob is `minecraft:arrow`, not `minecraft:trident`
- A wither skull's hit on a mob is `minecraft:magic`, not `minecraft:wither_skull`
- Evoker fangs on a mob are `minecraft:magic`, not `minecraft:indirect_magic`
- A fireball nobody shot is `minecraft:fireball`, not `minecraft:unattributed_fireball`
- A shulker bullet's hit has no `minecraft:mob_projectile`
- A bed or respawn anchor blast on a mob is `minecraft:explosion`, not `minecraft:bad_respawn_point`
- A blast from TNT a player lit is `minecraft:explosion` on a mob, not `minecraft:player_explosion`
- A bed or respawn anchor blast on the dragon is `minecraft:explosion`, not `minecraft:bad_respawn_point`
- A blast a mob caused (an end crystal a skeleton shot, a creeper's) is `minecraft:explosion` on the dragon, not
  `minecraft:player_explosion`

A registered damage type Horizon keeps no kind of its own for keeps its id and its tags on a mob and the dragon: a
datapack's `demo:heat` hurt through `ApplyEffectTickEvent::hurt` or `entity_hurt` reaches the hurt hooks as
`demo:heat`.

The causing and direct entities are 0 for now in these cases:

- A player's direct entity outside a projectile hit, and `magic()` dealt during one (an ownerless wither
  skull, instant harm from a tipped arrow): vanilla's source names no entity
- A player's causing entity, except for a mob that shot the projectile, the mob `/damage` names, an evoker that summoned
  the fangs, a slime or magma cube that touched the player, and a mob that exploded (a sulfur cube's is guessed until
  its blast names its source)
- A mob's causing and direct entities when a player is behind a hit outside a scoped attack (for example TNT
  a player lit); a projectile's hit does run inside its owner's attack
- A mob's direct entity when it isn't the causing one outside a projectile hit (for example a TNT blast)
- A falling block on a mob, whose causing and direct entity is the block in vanilla
- The dragon's direct entity for a blast
- The dragon's causing player when it isn't the acting one on a LAN guest's turn
- `/damage` on a mob `by` an entity with a damage type that isn't melee: the direct entity is 0, not that entity

And `/damage` on a mob `by` one entity `from` another with a melee damage type gives the `from` entity as the direct
one, where vanilla gives the `by` one.


`menu_button` handles a mod container's button (`AbstractContainerMenu.clickMenuButton(Player, int)`) on the server, for single player and LAN guests. It exposes the player identity, button, block entity and mutable carried stack, so a widget outside the slots can take or give what the player carries.

- `native_block_entity_sync(pos)`, which sends the block and its update tag to clients again
  (`Level.sendBlockUpdated`): with the level's block changes, to the players who see its chunk, once per position
  however often it is called in a tick. A change made in a block entity's tick reaches clients at the start of the
  next tick, as in vanilla. Call it when what clients show changes, not for every tick's progress: a menu's data slots
  carry that.

- `entity_leave_level(dimension, entity, kind)`, an entity leaving a server level (NeoForge's
  `EntityLeaveLevelEvent`, vanilla's `onTrackingEnd`): removed for any reason or its chunk unloading, not the entities
  still loaded when the server stops. It only hears. It tells item entities, experience orbs and mobs (`kind` is the mob type) so far; check `kind`.

- Fluid tanks on a mod block's block entity, in millibuckets (a bucket is a thousand). `r.block_fluids(&block, tanks)` registers `ModFluidTanks`, as `r.block_container(&block, container)` registers slots: each tank's capacity, the
  tanks each face reaches, and which a fill may reach and a drain may take; the tanks' contents live in the entity's saved compound under
  `fluids`, so they survive restarts, and the block's own tick reads them there. Other blocks and mods reach them, and a
  cauldron's, through the [`FLUIDS` capability](../concepts/capabilities/block-fluids.md).

- What the mob effects of a content mod ([installing and using mods](../start/installing.md)) do, named after vanilla's `MobEffect` methods,
  or NeoForge's event where it has one. On the server, each tick a player or a mob has one,
  `should_apply_effect_tick_this_tick` says whether it acts (vanilla's base answer is no) and
  `native_apply_effect_tick` acts, and may end it, before it counts down, as in `MobEffectInstance.tickServer`. These
  two take `&self`: during a mob's tick the mob world borrows the game, so `&mut self` would alias that borrow, and the
  game doesn't hold the mobs being ticked, nor the player's effects. `on_effect_added` hears it given to an
  entity that didn't have it, and `mob_effect_added` (NeoForge's `MobEffectEvent.Added`) every time it is given.
  A mob is its `Entity.getId`; a player is None, with their state swapped in (`host.players().acting_player`). Vanilla's effects
  never reach them.
  The three moments around them cover every effect, vanilla's included: `mob_effect_applicable`
  (NeoForge's `MobEffectEvent.Applicable`, vanilla's `canBeAffected`) answers whether an effect can land — the first
  mod to answer `Allow` or `Deny` overrides the vanilla tag check, and an unanswered hook falls
  back to it; `mob_effect_expired` (`.Expired`) hears one count down to nothing — cancelling
  refuses the expiry, and the effect stays, kept at no ticks and asked again next tick;
  `mob_effect_remove` (`.Remove`) hears one about to be removed by any path — a command, milk or a
  mod's removal helper — and cancelling keeps it. All three name their entity as a `LivingRef`, the player's own included.

- Chunks and players coming and going, on the server: `chunk_load` (with whether the chunk is new), `chunk_unload`, and
  `player_logged_in` and `player_logged_out`, which come in pairs however a player leaves, the server stopping included. Changes made to the departing chunk in `chunk_unload` aren't saved: as in vanilla, the chunk is saved before it unloads.

  One tick's streaming step (`update_world`) runs in this order:

  1. The chunks that come and go are worked out. A chunk saved while that is planned is copied for its save there.
  2. The arriving chunks join the level and the departing ones leave it.
  3. Each departing chunk that changed since its last save is copied, with its block entities and save data, and the
     copy is queued to save.
  4. `chunk_load` runs for each arriving chunk (`native_chunks_loaded`).
  5. `chunk_unload` runs for each departing chunk.
  6. The departing chunks' entities, block entities and block names are dropped.

  So an edit a `chunk_load` listener makes to a chunk departing in the same tick (a neighbour's block entity,
  say) comes after that chunk's save copy (step 3): it is not saved, and step 6 drops it. That is the difference from an
  ordinary load, where the edit lands in a chunk that stays and is saved with its next save, and it is the same rule as
  `chunk_unload`, whose edits also come after the copy. Change a chunk you may lose from a later tick instead,
  after checking it is still loaded.
- Sounds the server plays to its players: `native_play_level_sound_at_position` and `native_play_level_sound_at_entity`
  (NeoForge's `PlayLevelSoundEvent.AtPosition` and `.AtEntity`, in `ServerLevel.playSeededSound`). As in vanilla, a mob's own
  sounds (`Entity.playSound`) are at its position; only `playSound(except, sourceEntity, ...)` sounds are at an entity: vanilla's
  sites go through `Game::play_bound_sound` (the mobs' through `MobEvent::BoundSound`), which queues them for the end of the
  tick, after the tick's other sounds; the goat horn and a mod's bound sound ask directly. Two sites keep a difference: dye on a
  sheep and an allay's sounds reach the player who caused them too, since Horizon's client plays them from the packet rather
  than predicting them. The packet stays positional (horizon-rust/horizon#9284). A mod may change the sound, its source, volume and pitch, or cancel it. Every
  server sound packet but `/playsound`'s goes through `Game::send_level_sound` (`game/interface/level_sounds.rs`), or the native-sound
  flush for a mod's own, so a new sound site asks the mods by calling it. The tick's sounds are asked as they go out, at the end
  of the tick. With no listener, the cost is one `listened` check per sound and nothing is allocated.
- Chunks a player watches, on the server: `chunk_watch(player, chunk)`, `chunk_sent(player, chunk)` and
  `chunk_unwatch(player, chunk)` (NeoForge's `ChunkWatchEvent.Watch`, `Sent` and `UnWatch`). Each chunk that comes into a
  player's view is watched, then sent; it's unwatched when it leaves the view, when the player leaves the level (a portal, a
  teleport, a respawn) and when they disconnect, in the level it was watched in. Vanilla watches a chunk when it queues it; Horizon
  picks a chunk only as it sends it, so the watch comes just before the send. The hub records them only while a mod listens and
  the game tells them after the hub's network step for that level, so a handler sees the state after that step; the order per
  player and chunk is vanilla's. The far ring's columns past the view distance aren't told, and the server stopping doesn't unwatch.
- A chunk's ticket level changing, on the server: `chunk_ticket_level_updated(chunk, old, new)` (NeoForge's
  `ChunkTicketLevelUpdatedEvent`). The level is the chunk's loading level from its tickets (a player, a forced chunk, a portal
  ticket, the dragon fight's arena), on `ChunkLevel`'s scale: 31 and lower entity ticking, 32 block ticking, 33 loaded without
  ticking, and `ChunkTicketLevel::Unloaded` past it, so a non-ticking or unloaded chunk is never clamped to the ticking range.
  Horizon keeps no level for a chunk partway through generating, and no chunk holder to hand over. The level's tickets keep each
  change, in the order they were made, only while a mod listens: with no listener an update of the tickets looks at no chunk
  and allocates nothing, so the tick costs what it did. A level is told in its own tick, after the tickets were updated for its players.

- [the renderer's functions](#render-functions): `world_drawn`, called once the world is drawn with its colour, depth, matrices and entity geometry, and
  `render_needs`, where a mod asks for the entity runs and the world's depth without a shader pack.

- [entities](#entities) for server mods: `native_summon(dimension, kind, pos, nbt)` spawns any entity from its compound
  as `/summon` does.

- `item_bar(stack, bar)`: the small bar `GuiGraphicsExtractor.itemDecorations` draws under an item,
  wherever the game shows one. `bar` arrives holding
  vanilla's choice (the damage bar, or a bundle's fullness, already applied); set it to a width `0..=13` and an
  `rgb` colour, or to `None` to hide it. Asked each frame a stack is drawn. Client-side (NeoForge has no event for
  this; vanilla's `Item.isBarVisible`/`getBarWidth`/`getBarColor`).

- Mods' own sound events in `play_sound`: an event of another namespace than `minecraft` (`mymod:machine_hum`) is sent to players by
  name, as vanilla sends a sound that isn't in its registry, and they hear it when their resources define it (a content mod's `assets/mymod/sounds.json`
  and its `.ogg` files). `minecraft:` events must still be registered.

- Nicknames for server mods: `player.set_nickname(host, Option<&str>)` shows a name in place of a player's in chat (their messages, `/me`, `/msg`) and the Tab list, the real name on hover and everywhere else; `host.messages().text_allowed(text)` asks the server's chat filter. Obtain a `PlayerRef` from `host.players().server_players()` or `.acting_player()` and retain that value, not the borrowed service. The handle is tied to its world epoch and entity identity: nickname writes refuse stale or offline players, but can reach a connected player displaced by another player's turn. A nickname already set persists across reconnects until changed or the server stops.

- Tag and fluid reads from any hook that has a `Host`: `host.block_in_tag(oak_log, "minecraft:logs")`, `host.item_stack_in_tag(&stack, tag)` (`ItemStack.is(TagKey)`), `host.state_fluid_state(state)` (`BlockState.getFluidState`: water for a waterlogged state, `None` for an id no state has) and `host.fluid_in_tag("minecraft:water", "minecraft:water")`. The tag may be written with or without `minecraft:`, with no `#`. They read the world's merged tags, data packs and content mods included; an unknown tag is false and an empty stack tests `minecraft:air`. On a client they read the tags its server sent. The tag reads are `None` before those or the world's tags are loaded. `host.state_outline(state)` (`BlockState.getShape` with an empty getter at the origin) gives a state's outline boxes in the block's own space, with no random offset and no world context; empty for air, `None` for an id no state has. `host.tag_members(TagRegistry::Block, tag)` (also `Item` and `Fluid`; `HolderSet.Named` iteration) lists a tag's members in vanilla's order, the file's order with nested tags in place and the first occurrence kept: an unknown tag lists nothing, and it is `None` where the tag reads are. `level.fluid_state(host, pos)` (`BlockGetter.getFluidState`) reads the fluid at a position, `None` where the block read is (an unloaded chunk or a `y` outside the world).
- Fluid facts from any hook that has a `Host`, on either side and with no world: `host.fluid_is_same("minecraft:water", "minecraft:flowing_water")` (`Fluid.isSame`: a source and its flowing form are one fluid; false when either id names no fluid), `host.fluid_bucket(fluid)` (`Fluid.getBucket`: `minecraft:water_bucket` or `minecraft:lava_bucket`), `host.fluid_pickup_sound(fluid)` (`Fluid.getPickupSound`: `minecraft:item.bucket.fill` or `minecraft:item.bucket.fill_lava`) and `host.fluid_empty_sound(fluid)` (`BucketItem.playEmptySound`: `minecraft:item.bucket.empty` or `minecraft:item.bucket.empty_lava`). Fluids are named by id, with or without `minecraft:`. The bucket and the sounds are `None` for `minecraft:empty`, which has neither (vanilla's bucket there is air), and for an id no fluid has; the empty sound is `None` too for a tank-only fluid, which no bucket pours.

- A block part's `is_pathfindable` changes whether a path of a `PathComputationType` (`Land`, `Water`, `Air`) may go through the block's states (`BlockBehaviour.isPathfindable`); `event.pathfindable` starts with the block's own answer. The answer depends on the state and the type alone: the game asks once per state and type when parts resolve (at world load and on every `/reload`) and path finding, spawning and the goals read the stored answer, so a part cannot answer from a position, a level or the time. Server-side.
- A block part's `should_check_weak_power` adjusts whether a signal query reads indirect power through that block, for its position and input direction. Block entity neighbour notices use `on_neighbor_change`; `weak_changes` opts the farther block into notices through a conductor (see the block entity neighbours concept page).

- A block part's `should_redstone_wire_connect_to` adjusts whether redstone wire connects to that block for the given position and optional direction.

- A block part's `connects_to` says whether a fence, a wall, or iron bars or a glass pane of that block connects a side toward a neighbour state. `event.kind` names vanilla's rule and `event.connected` starts with its answer: `ConnectionKind::Fence` is `FenceBlock.connectsTo` (a solid face, a fence of the same kind, a gate across the arm), `Wall` is `WallBlock.connectsTo` (a wall, a solid face, bars or a pane, a gate across the side; a connected side is still low or tall from the block above) and `Bars` is `IronBarsBlock.attachsTo`, for iron bars and panes, which are one block class (a solid face, bars or a pane, a wall). Set it to false to deny a connection as well as to true to make one. The neighbour answers first, in its own `can_be_connected_to`, and `event.connected` starts from that answer: the connecting block has the last word. `pos` and `state` are the block being shaped, `neighbour` the state beside it, `direction` the way from the block to the neighbour (vanilla's bars rule takes none) and `face_solid` whether the neighbour's face toward it is sturdy. It is asked on placement and on every shape update toward a side, on authoritative servers only, and only the block's own part answers, so vanilla blocks cost nothing. The three rules stay separate in the library; only the question a mod is asked is shared, and `kind` leaves room for fields one kind alone needs. Diverges from upstream: new hook.

  **Migration (`fence_connects_to` → `connects_to`, contract version 2):** a part that implemented `fence_connects_to(&self, level, event: &mut FenceConnectsToEvent)` implements `connects_to(&self, level, event: &mut ConnectsToEvent)` instead. The event's fields are the same plus `kind`; a part that only answered for fences returns early unless `event.kind == ConnectionKind::Fence`. The answer, its timing and the fence's own rule are unchanged.

- A mod block's comparator output, as vanilla's `BlockBehaviour.hasAnalogOutputSignal` and `getAnalogOutputSignal`: `has_analog_output` says a block of yours has one,
  and `analog_output` gives it (0 to 15) for its state and position. A state change with neighbour updates tells the comparators itself; when the output
  changes otherwise, `level.update_neighbors(host, pos, state, NeighbourUpdate::OutputSignal)` makes them read it again (`Level.updateNeighbourForOutputSignal`).

`Hooks::component_types`, `blocks`, `items` and `standalone_models` take
`&RegistrationContext` before their event; `Hooks::register` takes it after
its `Registrar`. `context.mods()` returns a read-only `LoadedMods` view whose
`ids()` lists startup code and selected content packages in dispatch order.
`context.registry("minecraft:item")` lists a built-in registry's names in ID order and
`context.setting(mod_id, key)` reads a loaded mod's setting, so a mod can validate the keys it
declares before its Parts are finalized. Both read one view the engine captures before the first
registration hook runs: every registration step sees the same registries (as `registries.json`
lists them, without what mods declare during registration) and the settings on disk at that
moment, whatever the dispatch order. A read fails with a `RegistrationReadError` rather than
panicking: `InvalidRegistryName` for a name that is not a namespaced identifier,
`UnknownRegistry`, `InvalidSettingKey` for an empty key or one naming a path, `UnknownMod` for a
package that is not loaded, and `Unavailable` when the engine supplied no data. These contexts are
supplied by the engine and have no game `Host`, handle constructors or transactions. Declarations
still go on each event or registrar.

- `component_types(context, types)` runs once before content loads. Append namespaced component IDs; duplicates, invalid IDs and the `minecraft` namespace stop startup. `native_component`, `native_set_component` and `native_remove_component` read, set and remove registered components, including item defaults. Values use NBT and must fit the network reader limits.

- [explosions](#explosions) for server mods: `LevelRef::explode(host, source, center, radius, fire, interaction)` sets one
  off as `Level.explode` does, with an optional source entity and `ExplosionInteraction::None`, `Block`, `Mob`, `Tnt` or
  `Trigger` for what it does to blocks.

- Dispenser behaviours are chosen at `DispenserBlock.getDispenseMethod`, before any vanilla behaviour, for mod or vanilla items, on the authoritative server only (droppers are unaffected). The block the dispenser faces is asked first: `dispense_method` gives its part the dimension, dispenser position, facing, the selected stack and `state`, the block at `pos` moved by `facing` (air included), and the part is asked only for that block. Then, unless that part answered, the item's own part is asked by `dispense_item` with the same dimension, position, facing and stack. Either answer is `Some((remainder, event))`: a `None` remainder empties the slot, `Some(stack)` writes that remainder without consuming again, and `event` is the level event played with the smoke (1000 click, 1001 fail, 0 nothing, as `NOOP`). The first answer wins: the other part is not asked and vanilla's behaviour doesn't run. `host.dispense_default(dimension, pos, facing, stack)` drops one item normally, including items with a special vanilla behaviour: answer its remainder with 1000. Leave the answer `None` to let vanilla decide, as before.

- Image tooltip components: `tooltip_component(stack, size)` answers finite positive width/height in GUI pixels, and `tooltip_component_draw(stack, batch, origin, size)` draws that component with `native_sprite`, `native_fill` and `native_text`. The stack supplies its data. Space and background are reserved after the text and any vanilla bundle component; the component width participates in tooltip positioning. Neither hook changes ordinary tooltips without an answer. Client-side.

- `ClientHost::modifiers()` returns a `ClientModifiers` snapshot of the window's shift, control, alt and super keys, using the same GLFW bits as the input hooks. It is available outside a world and clears on focus loss. Reading it copies the current modifier state; it does not allocate or dispatch hooks.

- `Hooks::render_tooltip_gather_components` (NeoForge's `RenderTooltipEvent.GatherComponents`, client-side, cancellable): an item's tooltip as one list of `TooltipElement`s, a `Text` line with its colour or an `Image` (a `TooltipImage`: its `TooltipImageSource` selects the built-in bundle renderer or an item part, carrying the stack and measured size in GUI pixels), after `item_tooltip` and before anything is wrapped or measured. Add, change, reorder or remove elements. `max_width` starts at -1, no limit, which leaves the lines as vanilla draws them; a mod that sets it wraps every line wider than that. Cancel and nothing is drawn. An image with a non-finite or non-positive size is dropped.

- `Hooks::render_tooltip_pre` (NeoForge's `RenderTooltipEvent.Pre`) is asked for each tooltip about to be placed and drawn, after `render_tooltip_gather_components`: item tooltips and text tooltips (a button's, a book's, the creative tab names), not the selected-item name a bundle draws beside its grid. `place` is the point the tooltip hangs from (the cursor, or the point its screen gives), before the positioner adds its offset and keeps the box on screen; set its `x` and `y` to move it. `screen_width` and `screen_height` are the screen's size. `elements` are the list `render_tooltip_gather_components` left, text and images (the built-in bundle grid included) in that order, read-only (change them in `render_tooltip_gather_components`), and `stack` is the item it describes, `None` for a text tooltip. Set `cancel` and nothing is drawn and no `render_tooltip_texture` is asked. It runs each frame a tooltip shows, only while a mod listens. Diverges from upstream: new hook.

- `Hooks::component_hover` (vanilla's `GuiGraphicsExtractor.componentHoverEffect`; NeoForge has no event for it) is asked for the hover of the text component under the cursor in the chat, a book or a dialog, before the game draws it. `hover` is the typed hover action (`TextHover`: its text, an item or an entity), `x` and `y` the cursor. Set `cancel` and the game draws nothing for it, and a mod can draw its own with `draw`. Left alone, a text hover is split at half the screen's width (at least 200), an item hover draws its stack's tooltip, which asks `item_tooltip` and the `render_tooltip_*` hooks as any item tooltip does, and an entity hover shows its name, type and UUID while advanced tooltips are on. It runs each frame a hovered component shows, only while a mod listens. Diverges from upstream: new hook.

- [advancement triggers](#advancement-triggers) of a mod's own: `player.trigger_criterion(host, trigger, test)` fires a trigger
  an advancement of a content mod or a data pack names (`mymod:pipe_connected`) for one player, as a NeoForge mod's
  `SimpleCriterionTrigger.trigger`.

- Where a mod block can stay, on an authoritative server. `can_survive(dimension, pos, state, survives)` answers
  `BlockState.canSurvive` before the block does: as it is placed (`BlockItem.canPlace`: `Some(false)` refuses the spot),
  from the shape update of a block whose template checks it (a plant, a torch, a sign: `Some(false)` breaks it with its
  drops when a neighbour changes), and wherever else vanilla asks. `state` may not be in the world yet, so decide from
  `state`. `may_place_on(dimension, state, ground, ground_pos, may)` answers `VegetationBlock.mayPlaceOn` for a
  mod plant (a block whose template is a vanilla plant, such as a crop): the blocks it can stand on, which its
  template's `canSurvive` asks, so it is refused elsewhere and pops off when its ground changes. Answer only for your
  own blocks and leave the answer empty otherwise; the level is read-only. Both run on every shape update of such a
  block: keep them short.

- Drawing mod block entities on the client. `block_entity_submit(pos, block, state, entity, draw)` runs once a frame
  for each mod block entity in view, as vanilla's `BlockEntityRenderer.submit` does (within its view distance, 64 blocks
  unless `block_entity_view_distance` answers otherwise, asked once per mod block and kept, again after a resource reload or a world change; Diverges from upstream: new hook; in the frustum,
  its chunk faded in), with the copy the server sent (`block_entity_update_tag`). It draws into the entity batch
  under `draw`'s pose stack (`push`, `pop`, `translate`, `rotate_about`, `scale`, in blocks from the block's corner, as
  vanilla's `PoseStack`): `native_draw_quad` (four corners and a sprite's UVs), `native_draw_cube` (a model element's box,
  its faces baked as a model's are, each a `CubeFace::new(sprite)`, `.with_uv(uv)` for UVs of its own), `native_draw_block` (a block
  state's model, as `submitBlockModel`: a moving part is often a block of the mod's own) and `native_draw_text`
  (`BlockEntityDrawContext::text(text, at, rgb, glowing, outline)`: a component in the game's font, as a sign's line or a
  text display's, in font pixels with y down as `Font.drawInBatch` lays it out under the pose, with its styles   (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, obfuscated, fonts, `§` codes), opaque `0xRRGGBB`, in the frame's light or full bright when
  `glowing` (a nixie tube), ringed with `outline` when given; `text_width` measures it, styles included, to centre it).   Parts drawn after `spin` turn on the client's animation clock (`animation_time`) and are lit where they turn to. Sprites are the atlas's:
  `<ns>:block/...` and `block/...`, and a content mod's `assets/<ns>/textures/entity/` as `<ns>:entity/...`. Culling uses the bounds
  `block_entity_render_bounding_box` gives (NeoForge's `getRenderBoundingBox`): the block with a block of margin
  unless the mod widens them, or never culled when a bound is infinite. Both run every frame for every one in view: keep
  them cheap.

- Bone meal on a mod block, the `BonemealableBlock` three questions a block nothing in Horizon knows one for
  answers itself: `is_valid_bonemeal_target(state, valid)` says whether the block takes bone meal (`Some(false)` refuses it even where its template takes it, `None` leaves the
  template's; asked on both sides, as vanilla asks it, so a client predicts the use); `is_bonemeal_success(state, success)` is
  `isBonemealSuccess`, drawn from `native_level_random()` to keep vanilla's order; and `perform_bonemeal(state)`
  is the growth itself, with `native_set_block`/`native_set_block_property`. The meal is used up and the growth
  particles and sound follow as vanilla's do, whether or not the roll grows the block, from a player's bone meal, a
  dispenser's and, on a crop, a villager's. A block that answers nothing keeps the `BonemealableBlock` its template gives it.
  Authoritative servers only, except the first question.

- Bone meal on any block: `Hooks::bonemeal` (NeoForge's `BonemealEvent`) hears every `BoneMealItem.growCrop`, before
  the block is asked anything: a player's use on both sides, a dispenser's and a villager's. It names the player (none for a
  dispenser or a villager), the block, the `source`, the stack (what the mod changes stays) and `valid_bonemeal_target`, the
  block's own answer. Cancel it and the growth, the block's bone meal Parts and the meal's use are skipped: `growCrop`
  answers `successful` (`setSuccessful`), false unless the mod sets it, so a player's use still tries the water plant
  beside the clicked face. A mod growing only its own blocks answers the three questions above instead.

- Mod-block entity contacts: `block_step_on` receives the server dimension, entity id/type, block state and position. Landing is a block Part method, not a global hook (`block_fall_on` is removed; it diverges from upstream): `BlockPart::fall_on` (`Block.fallOn`) receives the fall distance and mutable calculated damage; zero prevents fall hurt and its generic fall sounds. Creative and fall-immune entities notify with zero and retain immunity. Invalid non-finite damage changes are ignored; negative damage is clamped to zero. `BlockPart::bounce_on` (`Block.bounceOn`) fires only when the entity bounced, just before vanilla sets its movement, and may change the movement the bounce leaves. Both run synchronously inside the entity's move on the level random host (reads blocks, draws the level's random in vanilla's order, attachments; no writes); players and mobs fire them, and dropped items fire `fall_on` (kind `minecraft:item`, zero damage, read and act on the item through `ItemEntityRef`; an item's `bounce_on` is not fired yet). An item's fall distance grows by its moves down out of water and resets in water and on landing, as `Entity.checkFallDamage` has it; with no Part on the block it lands on, the landing costs one `fall_listens` lookup. `fall_on` asks for writes with `event.request(LandingWrite::SetBlock(state))` or `LandingWrite::DestroyBlock { drop }` (farmland to dirt after its random draw, a turtle egg breaking): they apply at the batch end through the same drain as `entity_inside`, in the order asked, if the block is still the state the entity landed on.
- `Block.entityInside` is `BlockPart::entity_inside(host, event)` (`EntityInsideEvent { state, pos, entity, precise }`; `precise` is `Entity.checkInsideBlocks`' flag), the Part form of what `block_entity_inside` was; there is no global hook (NeoForge has no bus event for it). It fires mid-sweep, inside the entity's move, on the level random host (`&mut dyn LevelRandomHost`, like `fall_on`): a Part reads blocks and draws the level's random in vanilla's order, interleaved with the vanilla blocks of the same walk; only writes are restricted to the event. The Part queues its writes: `event.apply(InsideEffect::…)` is one of the five `InsideBlockEffectType`s, `event.run_before`/`run_after(effect, EntityWrite)` a typed write to the swept entity (applied inside its own tick, in `StepBasedCollector` order, stopping when it dies), `event.request(InsideWrite::…)` a level write at the touched block, applied at the batch end, guarded on the state (the `fall_on` contract: the complete batch is checked, an invalid state refuses all of the callback's writes). Only a block state a Part listens for fires it; with no listening Part nothing is recorded and the walk allocates nothing. A `Hurt` whose source the entity table answers `Taken` for (its list is lifted that moment, #1606) is refused with a typed error, not a retry and not a panic. Players, mobs, items and projectiles all fire it on the shared walk, inside their own tick or batch; the level writes a contact asked for still land at the batch end, through the drain the landings use. The block's `getEntityInsideCollisionShape`/`insideBlock` shape that decides "inside" is not exposed (tracked on #44).

- A consumable's effect of a mod's own kind. The item's `on_consume_effects` entry of a type in a namespace of its own reaches `consume_effect(kind, data)` when the
  item is consumed, on the server thread, for the acting player. The kind and the payload converted once to a retained `Tag` at definition load are there;
  the game's own effects, sounds, teleports and drops are open to the hook. An unclaimed kind does nothing.
  The hook sees the item's own consumable component, not a patch on the stack; a bare vanilla name and an unknown `minecraft:` kind are the loader's, not the hook's.

- [loot table hooks](#loot-tables), for changing loot a mod didn't make. `loot_table_load(context, id, table)`, in `horizon-world`'s `loot.rs`, gets each loot table's JSON as it loads, after the data packs' (NeoForge's `LootTableLoadEvent`, Fabric's `LootTableEvents.MODIFY`): add pools or entries, change or replace it, and chests, block and mob drops, fishing and the rest then roll the changed table. It runs on the server for each data load and reload, not client preloads. `loot_drops(context, drops)` gets the items a broken block or a dead mob is about to drop, to add, change or take out (global loot modifiers, `MODIFY_DROPS`), with `LootDrops`: the table rolled, the dimension, the origin, the block or the mob, the player who broke or killed it, the tool and an explosion's radius. It hears blocks a player, an explosion or a mob breaks, not other breaks such as leaves decaying.

- `state_for_placement(state, context, fluid, answer)`: the state a block is about to be placed in
  (`Block.getStateForPlacement(BlockPlaceContext)`), `state` the block's own default state. Answer only for your own
  blocks: `answer` set to `Some(Some(state))` places that state (a state of that block, as vanilla sets properties on its own
  `defaultBlockState`; another block's is ignored), `Some(None)` refuses the placement (vanilla's `null`:
  the block goes nowhere and the stack is kept), and left empty the block's own placement runs. `context` is vanilla's
  `BlockPlaceContext`: the clicked face, the placer's rotation, the clicked position, whether the clicked block is
  being replaced and the item in hand. `fluid` is the fluid in the position the block would go in, which a
  waterlogged block reads. It is asked for every placer that goes through vanilla's placement (a player's
  `BlockItem.place`, a dispenser's `DirectionalPlaceContext`), and the answer still takes its survival and entity
  obstruction checks. `native_state_with_property(state, key, value)` builds the state from `state` and one of its
  properties, its own declared ones included. Authoritative servers only.

- A `minecraft:post_attack` enchantment effect of a mod's own kind, on a mob a player's weapon hit: `enchant_effect` (see
  [A mod's own enchantment effect kinds](../how-to/items/enchantment-effect-kinds.md)).

- `screen_render_post`, the point of `ScreenEvent.Render.Post`: a native mod draws over the open screen after it and its tooltips, given its id, the server-opened menu's vanilla type (`menu`) and title, its container panel, its slot count, the mouse in GUI pixels and the partial tick (`ScreenView`). Every container, station and mod window draws on the inventory screen and so reports `inventory`: tell them apart by `menu` and `title` (None on a window the client opened) and by `slots`. It does not fire on the title screen, nor for the prompts, books and sign editors drawn over gameplay after it.

- `native_screen_exclusion()` answers the rectangles (`[x, y, width, height]`, GUI pixels) the open screen keeps clear for the things drawn beside its window: the recipe book's panel, the creative tab rows above and below the window, and the active effects right of the inventory, then every rectangle a mod added in `screen_exclusion_areas(screen, areas)` (a side panel, a button column; a mod that draws over a screen reports where). Compute it once per screen layout and cache it, not per frame: the rectangles move only when the window, the recipe book or the effects change. A mod that lays out panels of its own, as a recipe viewer does, shrinks its rows and columns around them. Empty and non-finite rectangles are dropped. Empty with no screen up. Vanilla has no counterpart; NeoForge recipe viewers take the same from their own API (EMI's `EmiExclusionArea`, JEI's `IGuiContainerHandler.getGuiExtraAreas`). Client-side.

- `native_item_burn_time(item)` answers the item's cooking-fuel burn time in ticks (`FuelValues.burnDuration`: its `cooking_fuel` component, the data pack's context int provider resolved), None where it is no fuel. `native_item_compost_chance(item)` answers the chance the item raises a composter's level (its `compostable` component's layers provider resolved; the `compostables` data map), None where it is not compostable. A mod cannot resolve either from the item's default component, which holds only the provider's name. Client-side, API next.
- `native_screen_hovered_item()` answers the id of the item in the slot under the pointer on the open container screen (`AbstractContainerScreen.getHoveredSlot()`'s stack), None over no slot, an empty one, or with no window. A recipe viewer reads it for its look-up keys. Client-side, API next.
- `menu.slot_boxes(host)` (`menu_slot_boxes`) answers the open inventory screen's slot rectangles (`[x, y, width, height]`, GUI pixels) in menu slot order: `AbstractContainerScreen.leftPos`/`topPos` plus each `Slot.x`/`Slot.y`, 16 by 16, so a mod that highlights or searches slots in `screen_render_post` draws where vanilla's own slot highlight does. `None` entries are slots the screen does not show; the whole answer is `None` for a stale menu, another screen, or an inventory covered by the recipe book. Client-side.

- `modify_default_components(context, item, components)`, in `horizon-world`'s `item_defaults.rs`: an item's default
  components in `items.json`'s form, for any item, vanilla's included (NeoForge's `ModifyDefaultComponentsEvent`). Insert
  or replace a component to set it (`"minecraft:max_stack_size": 16`), remove it to take it away. The item table,
  loot, enchanting and item models all read the changed defaults, and stacks are saved and sent against them as
  against vanilla's. A `minecraft:max_stack_size` above vanilla's 99 is kept, up to `i32::MAX`. Asked for every item
  each time the game reads the defaults: answer the same each time. Client and
  server each ask their own mods, so both need the mod.

- The open screen hears of a mouse button going down (`screen_mouse_button_pressed_pre`) or up (`screen_mouse_button_released_pre`) before it acts, as vanilla's `ScreenEvent.MouseButtonPressed.Pre` and `.MouseButtonReleased.Pre`: the screen, the GLFW button (0 left, 1 right, 2 middle, 3 back, 4 forward; a button past those is the platform's own number, which differs between systems) and GLFW's modifier bits (shift 1, control 2, alt 4, super 8), with the pointer in `screen.mouse`. A cancelled press goes no further (no slot, screen button, drag or hotbar key); cancel a release only when its press was cancelled, or a drag it ended stays held. They fire on the window only, never on the title screen itself (Options and the pack list opened from it do fire), the connect and loading screens, the prompts, books and sign editors drawn over gameplay, or while a world loads or saves, and never for a gamepad or keyboard-focus click.

- [falling blocks](#falling-blocks) for server mods: `native_spawn_falling_block(dimension, state, pos, velocity, falling)`
  throws a block that flies, lands and places itself as sand does, for debris and collapsing structures.

- Camera shake for client mods: `camera_shake(partial, shake)` asks each frame for turns in degrees and an
  offset in blocks, which add up across mods and multiply into the view after its bobbing. Horizon scales the sum by
  Distortion Effects and bounds it to 10 degrees and half a block on each axis.

- Client sounds: `ClientHost::play_local_sound(sound, after)` plays a `SoundPlay`, vanilla's event or the mod's own
  from its `assets/<id>/sounds.json`, for this player only: an interface sound (`SoundPlay::ui`) or one at a place
  (`SoundPlay::at`), now or up to a minute later, so a client mod can click its own buttons or time a blast's sound
  to its shock wave. Its `SoundRef` answers whether it plays, and stops or fades it.

- Values for a mod's own shader pack: `shader_params(partial, params)` asks each frame for eight `vec4`s that
  every stage of a Horizon shader pack reads as `frame.mods`, so a mod can tell the pack it bundles where and when
  something happened (an explosion's centre and age for a cloud drawn in a post pass).

- Menus of content mods' own menu types (vanilla's `MenuType`): a mod container's `menu` may name a menu type its content mod declares in `data/<id>/horizon/menu/` with as many slots ([making a content mod](../how-to/content-mods.md#menu-types)). It opens when the block is used, its data slots are the block entity's `data`, and a Horizon client shows it through the mod's `screen`. Server collect hooks `recipe_sources` and `menu_links` name lent ingredient and linked-slot containers; see the menu-types guide for ordering, caps, skips, write-back and the no-listener tick path.

- `block_highlight(pos, state, partial, canceled)` runs before building the eligible targeted block's selection outline, after hidden-HUD and game-mode restrictions. Set `canceled` to suppress only that outline; default behavior is unchanged otherwise. Position is block coordinates and state is the current block state ID. No entity outlines are affected.

- `render_hand(render, draw, canceled)` before each visible first-person hand, including maps, the empty main-hand arm and the empty off hand, where vanilla draws nothing. `render` carries the player UUID and entity id, hand, displayed stack, partial tick, interpolated pitch, light, swing and inverse equip height including swap animation scale. Adjust its translation (blocks), rotation (pitch, yaw, roll in degrees) and scale; the pose is applied in that order before the ordinary hand and item poses. Non-finite or out-of-range components are ignored individually: offsets must be within -16..=16 blocks, angles within -3600..=3600 degrees and scale within 0.01..=100. Set `canceled` to skip default geometry. `draw` draws in the hand, as the submit hooks' draws do: its pose stack starts in the hands' view space (blocks, +x right, +y up, -z into the screen) under the hand sway, before `render`'s pose and vanilla's per-item transforms, and both hands share it (`render.hand` says which one is asked). What a mod drew joins the hand's own vertices ahead of vanilla's, in a run of its own with no rendered item id, as the arm's: it gets the hand's field of view and the view bob, a shader pack's hand pass draws it, `hand_drawn` sees it, and it stays when the hand is cancelled. So cancel and draw to replace a hand, or draw without cancelling to add to it; it covers a hand that holds an item, where `render_arm` (vanilla's arm only) never fires, and the empty off hand, for a two-handed pose's second arm. Unlike NeoForge's `RenderHandEvent`, the pose stack is `draw`'s own: turning it moves what the mod draws, `render`'s pose moves the default geometry, and player render state is not exposed.

`screen_opening(current, new, outcome)` (`ScreenEvent.Opening`), `screen_closing(screen)` (`ScreenEvent.Closing`) and `screen_init_post(screen)` (`ScreenEvent.Init.Post`) take a `ScreenView`. Every change of the game's screen (all of the game's screen assignments) goes through `Game::set_screen`, which mirrors `Gui.setScreen`: when a different screen would open, `screen_opening` fires first with the screen that is open (`current`) and the one about to open (`new`; the id `playing` is vanilla's null, no screen), and answers `ScreenOpening::Cancel` (the current screen stays) or `ScreenOpening::ModScreen` (the answering mod's own screen opens instead, if it can open there; the replacement fires nothing again); the first mod to answer wins, and the dispatch records its id, so a mod can open only its own screen. Then `screen_closing` fires for the screen being left (never for `playing`), and the new screen opens. The same screen again fires nothing, and a game where no mod listens to `screen_opening` or `screen_closing` assigns the screen with no event. `screen_init_post` is still observed once per frame (an open or a resize). The screens of the game's `Screen` list (inventory, containers, pause, options, chat, creative, stats, advancements, mod screens, dead, win…) announce themselves in `set_screen`, before they change, and honour `Cancel` and `ModScreen`. The overlays drawn over gameplay (sign editors, book edit/sign/view and lectern screens, dialogs, and the command, link, code-of-conduct and server-pack prompts) open through `Game::open_screen_overlay`, which fires `screen_opening` before the overlay is set and honours `Cancel` and `ModScreen` in the same way (a canceled server-pack prompt leaves its packs unanswered, a canceled code of conduct leaves the server waiting, as in NeoForge), then `screen_closing` for an overlay it replaces. The title's own screens (`world_select`, `world_create`, `world_edit`, `multiplayer`, `onboarding`…) open in the same way: `Title::set_mode` asks for the screen while a mod listens to `screen_opening` or `screen_closing`, and the game fires `screen_opening` (from the title screen shown) and `screen_closing` for the one left before it applies it, after the window event or control command that asked; `Cancel` keeps the screen shown, and `ModScreen` opens the screen asked for, since a mod's own screen can't open over the title. The multiplayer list's own steps (`add_server`, `edit_server`, `direct_connect`, `server_delete`, `friends_join`, and back to `multiplayer`) are title screens too and go the same way. The title appearing as a whole (at startup, when a world closes, after a disconnect or a failed join) and going (when a world opens) goes through `Game::show_title` and `Game::hide_title`: `screen_opening` (from no screen to the title's screen, or back) and `screen_closing` for what it leaves fire before the change, and `screen_init_post` follows an appearance; a `Cancel` doesn't keep the title shut when there is no world to show instead, nor keep it open over a world that opens. Still announced by the per-frame observer, through the same function and in the same order but after the change, so a mod's answer can't keep it shut: an overlay's closing. Overlay views use the full window as their rectangle and have no menu or title; anvil rename remains part of its inventory screen. Dialog states share the `dialog` id. A menu swapped inside the open inventory screen is not a change of screen.

- `client_resources_reloaded()` fires on the render thread after successful client resource-pack application: the atlas, models, renderer and client caches already use the new resources. It covers selection/F3+T and server-pack reloads. Failed staging or application and initial startup do not fire it. This is a completion notification, not a reload-listener registration or staging API.
- `texture_atlas_stitched(atlas)` (NeoForge's `TextureAtlasStitchedEvent`) fires on the render thread once per atlas the resources publish, `TextureAtlas::Blocks` and then `TextureAtlas::Gui`: on the first load before `client_setup`, and after every successful reload before `client_resources_reloaded`. A failed reload fires nothing, and the old sprites stay right. Horizon packs vanilla's many atlases into these two: the block sprite arrays (`texture_sprites` answers a `SpriteRef`) and the GUI atlas of GUI sprites, particles and flat item and block textures (`gui_sprite` answers an `AtlasRegion`). Look up the sprites a mod draws here, once, and keep them until that atlas is stitched again; never by name every frame. `TextureAtlas` is `#[non_exhaustive]`. A dedicated server never fires it.

- `client_stopped` fires after the client shutdown finishes. `game_shutting_down` fires after that on clients and after the dedicated server stops, with a side-typed host. Both fire once on orderly process exit; neither fires for a splitscreen guest. There is no separate `client_started`: `client_setup` covers that moment.

- `client_stopping()` (Fabric's `ClientLifecycleEvents.CLIENT_STOPPING`; NeoForge has no event for it) fires once per game process, on the render thread, when the game shuts down: after the world the player was in is left and saved, with the settings and resources still held, so a listener can read them through the `ClientHost` and save its own client state. Closing the window, a quit shortcut and the stop signals reach it; a crash does not. A dedicated server and a splitscreen guest never fire it, as they never fire `client_setup`. Listeners are pure functions of the `ClientHost` reads and the mod's own state. Tick-time effect: none, it fires once at exit. Diverges from upstream: new hook.

- `client_setup()` (NeoForge's `FMLClientSetupEvent`) fires once per game process on the render thread, after the first client load has applied and before the title screen's first frame, with the `ClientHost`. It is the moment `client_resources_reloaded` skips: that one never runs at initial startup and runs after every later reload, while this one runs once and never again. Returning to the title screen and opening another world, or adding a splitscreen player, is not a new start. NeoForge's `DeferredWorkQueue` has no counterpart (the listener already runs on the thread that would drain it; work a mod wants in parallel is its own). A dedicated server has no client and never fires it; `FMLDedicatedServerSetupEvent` is `server_about_to_start`. A failing listener is handled like any other listener of a hook. Listeners are pure functions of the `ClientHost` reads and the mod's own state.

- `vanilla_game_event(dimension, event, pos, cause, affected_state, cancel)` (NeoForge's `VanillaGameEvent`) fires on the server for every vanilla game event before the sculk sensors, wardens and allays hear it; canceling keeps them from hearing it. `cause` is the network id of the entity that caused it (`GameEvent.Context.sourceEntity`, None for none) and `affected_state` is the block state the event touched (`GameEvent.Context.affectedState`): the block a player broke or placed, the block a mob stepped on, and None where vanilla passes none (`Context.of(entity)`). Contract version `2`: version `1` had no `affected_state`. With no listener the cost is one `listened` branch per event. Diverges from upstream.

- `get_arm_pose(entity_id, hand, stack, humanoid, pose)` (NeoForge's `IClientItemExtensions.getArmPose`) sets the pose of the arm that holds `stack` in `hand`, as a humanoid model draws it: the window's own player, remote players and humanoid mobs. `humanoid` is a borrowed `HumanoidRenderState` exposing both held stacks, the main arm, use hand, use ticks, use animation and the selected main/off-hand poses before listeners answer (including item declarations). It replaces what the item would give, whatever the use animation, a loaded crossbow or an `arm_pose` declared on the item say (a content mod's data key, see the content-mods how-to, is the answer when no mod listens or none sets one). Return one of vanilla's `ArmPose` values (`empty`, `item`, `block`, `bow_and_arrow`, `crossbow_hold`, `crossbow_charge`, `throw_trident`, `toot_horn`, `spyglass`, `spear`, `brush`); the first mod to answer wins. It is asked once a tick for each humanoid model and non-empty hand, only while a mod listens, and a two-handed pose still moves the other hand as vanilla's does. Custom poses are registered through `Registrar::register_arm_pose` and returned as `ArmPose::Custom`; `arm_pose_transform` writes their API-owned `ArmAngles` in radians. Unknown slots and non-finite angle components are ignored. Mob-specific animations run after the humanoid base pose, as in vanilla. API stack snapshots are converted only with subscribers; there is no allocation when no mod listens. Client-side, with the `ClientHost`. Diverges from upstream: new hook.

- `item_decorations(stack, x, y, batch)` appends custom GUI drawing after the default bar, cooldown shade and count have been painted for an item icon. The stack is the displayed stack, x/y are its icon's top-left in GUI units, the units the batch takes (no item-local translation remains active). Existing GUI helpers can draw badges, text and overlays. The shared path covers the hotbar, carried stacks, menu slots, recipe book and item tooltip icons, and the item icons of the advancement, beacon, stats and trading screens. `item_bar` still controls the bar separately; this hook does not suppress vanilla decorations.

- Using an item over time, as vanilla's `Item.getUseDuration`, `getUseAnimation` and `finishUsingItem` and NeoForge's `LivingEntityUseItemEvent.Start` and `.Finish`. `use_duration` answers a stack's use time: a mod's own item with no use of vanilla's that answers above 0 is used over time on a right click, until it is let go or the time runs out, on single player and LAN alike. `use_animation` changes the item's vanilla use animation, including specialised item poses, each first-person frame and each local or remote player model tick; a spear override without kinetic data is refused. `can_eat` decides whether a food can be eaten now. `living_entity_use_item_start` may change a use's duration or refuse it, on the server and where the window's client predicts the use, and `living_entity_use_item_finish` may replace what the hand holds once the time ran out (consumables, potions and mods' items), on the server and on the client that predicts it. Both take the using entity, None for a player, so mobs can fire them later, and the hand in use. Change the world only where this game runs the world, not on a server's client.

- Items and block state properties for drawing mod block entities: in `block_entity_submit`, `native_draw_item(draw,
  stack, display, owner_yaw, seed)` draws an item stack under `draw`'s pose as a campfire's or a shelf's
  (`ItemModelResolver.updateForTopItem` and `ItemStackRenderState.submit`, in the model's `display` transform; with `owner_yaw`, the block
  entity is the item's owner, as a shelf is, so a compass on it points from there). The client's copy of a block entity has
  no item slots: send the stacks you draw in `block_entity_update_tag` and read them from `entity.nbt`.
  `BlockState::property(metadata, "facing")` reads an owned state's property without a world lookup.
  Host callbacks supply `host.block_states()` as metadata; tint workers receive their explicit
  immutable metadata resource and never need a game host.

- The world's clock for client mods: `native_clock()` is the shown world's game time and time of day in ticks (`i64`; the day time counts on past 24000), none on the title screen.

- The open screen hears of the wheel (`screen_mouse_scrolled_pre`) before it scrolls, as vanilla's `ScreenEvent.MouseScrolled.Pre`: the screen, the scroll's x and y as the game's scroll handler scales them (a line times the wheel sensitivity: with Discrete Scrolling on, a notch is ±1, its sign only; a touchpad's pixels are divided by 30), GLFW's modifier bits (shift 1, control 2, alt 4, super 8) and the pointer in `screen.mouse`. A cancelled turn scrolls nothing: no bundle under the pointer, no list, slider or scrollbar, and no hotbar slot. It fires for the window's wheel (horizon-ctl's `scroll-at` included), never on the title screen itself (Options and the pack list opened from it do fire), the connect and loading screens, the prompts, books and sign editors drawn over gameplay, or while a world loads or saves, and never for a wheel a gamepad or the keyboard's focus sends.

- Keeping a mod block entity's geometry: `draw.keep()` in `block_entity_submit` keeps what that call drew, and the
  block is drawn the same again without calling `block_entity_submit` or `block_entity_render_bounding_box`
  until its state, its block entity (what the server sent), its light or the resource packs change, so idle machines cost
  no call into the mod each frame. Keep only geometry that reads none of `partial`, `game_time`, the blocks around it or other state of yours:
  kept geometry stands still (an enchanted item's glint, a clock or compass drawn with `native_draw_item`).

- Any command a player types: `player_command(player, name, command, cancel, replies)` is heard before the command is looked at (NeoForge's `CommandEvent`), without its slash, for vanilla's commands, the mods' own and commands the player may not run, once for each command a player sends, on a server. Also each line of a quiet command batch. A mod sets `canceled` to stop it: nothing runs and nothing is answered but the lines it pushes to `replies`, which reach the player as system chat.

- Redstone signals as a block reads them, on a level handle (`LevelRef`) on a server, through the game's own `SignalGetter`, mods' `block_signal` and `should_check_weak_power` parts included: `level.signal(host, pos, direction)` (`getSignal`, how strongly the block at `pos` powers its neighbour on the `direction` side, conducted power included), `level.direct_signal(host, pos, direction)` (`getDirectSignal`, the strong power alone), `level.direct_signal_to(host, pos)` (`getDirectSignalTo`), `level.best_neighbor_signal(host, pos)` (`getBestNeighborSignal`, the strongest power reaching `pos`, as a dispenser or a piston reads it) and `level.has_neighbor_signal(host, pos)` (`hasNeighborSignal`, stopping at the first powered side). Each costs what the game's own call does. They take `&dyn Host` and read the live signal state without a transaction or mutable level borrow. Block signal and weak-power Part callbacks receive the restricted `LevelHost`, so they cannot recursively invoke these signal helpers, just as on the write path. They read the level in place: None (or false) for another level, a stale handle or a client.

- `level.weather(host)` (rain and thunder levels, 0 in the Nether and the End), `level.day_time(host)` (the time of day), `level.height(host)` (min y and height) and `native_max_stack_size(item)`, with `level.brightness(host, layer, pos)` for light and `level.is_raining_at(host, pos)` for rain at a position: what a mod's solar panel, wind turbine, quarry or own container needs without reaching into Horizon's internals.

- Giving a whole stack (damage, name, enchantments kept) to any player from a server hook: `insert_any` into
  the player's [`ENTITY_ITEMS`](../concepts/capabilities/entity-items.md) handler places it as `Inventory.add` does, and answers how many went.

- Registered mod commands from every source use `run_mod_command(source, command, ran)`. Players retain their swapped-in state; the console has no acting player. Functions are silent, and block/cart feedback follows track-output. Unhandled invocations fail as unknown commands.

- Player-use drops to `loot_drops`: shears on a sheep, a mooshroom, a snow golem or a bogged, a brush on an
  armadillo or a suspicious block, carving a pumpkin, picking sweet berries or cave vines, and a player taking an item frame or
  its item pass through it, with `LootDrops::used` set and the player named.

- Server experience: `native_experience_orbs(dimension, min, max)` reads the experience orbs in a box; `PlayerRef::give_experience_points` gives points as an orb they touch does (Mending first), and `PlayerRef::give_levels` gives or, for a negative amount, takes levels.
- Server player death location: `PlayerRef::last_death_location(host)` reads where the player last died as a `GlobalPos`, the dimension's key and the block (`Player.getLastDeathLocation`, saved as `LastDeathLocation`, which the recovery compass follows). The dimension is data: a death in a dimension that is not open still reads, and `host.level(&pos.dimension().to_string())` gives the level when it is. `GlobalPos::new` takes an `Identifier` and `dimension()` returns `&Identifier`, so dimension keys are validated before they enter the typed API. Players resolve as in the other `PlayerRef` reads, so the acting player works too. It is `None` for a player who never died, a stale handle, and a player who is not online or whose record is swapped out. `set_last_death_location(host, location)` stores a location or, for `None`, forgets it (`Player.setLastDeathLocation`); the client hears of it with the player's next respawn, as in vanilla. It returns false in the same cases and for a dead player (so inside `player_died` the read works and the write does not).
- Server player rules: `PlayerRef::may_use_item_at(host, pos, face, stack)` is `Player.mayUseItemAt`: a player who may build always may, anyone else only with a stack whose `can_place_on` matches the block `pos` lies against (the check the game's own item use asks), `None` for a player in another level than the one in place. `can_harm(host, other)` is `ServerPlayer.canHarmPlayer`: the `pvp` rule and the two teams (attacks, arrows and tridents ask the same). `respawn_config(host)` reads the respawn point as `Some(Some(PlayerRespawnConfig { position, yaw, forced }))`, `Some(None)` for a player with none (the world spawn), and `set_respawn_config(host, config)` is `/spawnpoint`'s write, `None` forgetting it: the yaw wraps, `player_set_spawn` may cancel (false), and a dead player, a dimension the game doesn't have and a yaw that is not finite are refused. `text_filtering(host)` is the client's `ClientInformation.textFilteringEnabled` (false for the player running the server); it is the client's own option, so there is no write. The sleep reads are `sleep_ignored(host)` (what `set_sleep_ignored` left), `counts_for_sleep(host)` (the night's count: not a spectator, not a fake, not ignored while out of bed) and `sleep_timer(host)` (`Player.sleepCounter`: 100 once asleep long enough, 101 to 109 on the way up); `set_sleep_timer(host, ticks)` writes 0 to 109 through the sleep writes' guard (no fake player, no guest in another level). Writes take a `ServerHost`.

- Lead drops to `loot_drops`: untying a lead or cutting it with shears (`used`), and the lead a mob a
  player killed while leashed drops on its next tick, naming the killer.

- Native mod particle types to `native_send_particles`: `ParticleOptions::simple(spark_key)` with a load-resolved `ParticleKey` for `mymod:spark` sends a particle of the mod's own type, drawn by Horizon clients from the sprite set in the mod's `assets/<namespace>/particles/<path>.json` (`"textures": ["mymod:spark/1", ...]`, resolved as `particle/<texture>` in the atlas). The name must be namespaced; a client without that file draws nothing for it, vanilla clients (whose brand isn't Horizon's) aren't sent it, and the call still returns true. The type behaves as vanilla's `SimpleParticleType` with a sprite set: a plain billboard, no tint, 20 to 40 ticks, its motion the game's default spread (the speed sets its direction, not how fast it goes).

A mod particle may opt into declarative behaviour in that same particle JSON (no new hook API):

```json
{
  "textures": ["mymod:spark"],
  "horizon:behaviour": {
    "velocity": [0.0, 0.15, 0.0],
    "velocity_jitter": [0.02, 0.0, 0.02],
    "animation": "loop",
    "frame_ticks": 3,
    "gravity": 0.5,
    "friction": 0.96,
    "lifetime": 40,
    "size": [0.1, 0.0],
    "alpha": [1.0, 0.0]
  }
}
```

`animation` chooses how the particle walks through its sprites: `age` (first to last over its
lifetime), `loop` (cycles every `frame_ticks` ticks, 1..200, only valid with `loop`), `random` (one random
sprite, kept) or `first` (the first sprite, kept). Without `animation` the particle keeps the sprite it was
spawned with.

Every field is optional. Omit `horizon:behaviour` (or use `{}`) to keep the existing behaviour,
including its random draws, unchanged. `velocity` replaces the initial randomized velocity with
an exact vector in blocks/tick, plus the velocity the spawn call passed; omit it to retain the spawn's default spread. `velocity_jitter` adds a random
offset per axis, uniform in `-j..=j` (0..16 each, drawn from the particle's seeded generator, so the same
seed gives the same particle); declaring it alone starts from zero plus the spawn velocity. Each component must
be finite and within -16..16. `gravity` is the vanilla multiplier: each tick subtracts
`0.04 * gravity` from vertical velocity before moving (negative rises; range -100..100).
After movement, `friction` multiplies all velocity components (0..1); normal block collisions
and the vanilla on-ground horizontal multiplier of 0.7 still apply. Omitted gravity remains 0,
omitted friction remains the engine default (0.98), and omitted lifetime remains 20..39 ticks.
`lifetime` is an integer from 1 to 12000; removal uses the existing base tick: it moves that many
times and is removed on the following tick.

`size` and `alpha` are `[start, end]` linear curves over `age / lifetime`, clamped to their
endpoints. Size is billboard half-width/half-height in blocks (0..16), not a multiplier;
alpha is opacity (0..1). The start value applies immediately at spawn, then the curves update
once per tick, reaching the end after `lifetime` motion ticks. Omitted size keeps the random
spawn size; omitted alpha stays 1. Fading particles use the blended particle layer.
Malformed declarations, unknown behaviour fields, non-finite or out-of-range numbers reject the
whole behaviour object with a log warning, falling back to the existing particle behaviour;
the sprite set still loads. Vanilla particle JSONs are unaffected. Resource reloads apply new
declarations to newly spawned particles; live particles keep their spawn-time values.
The engine copies fixed-size numeric data at spawn and performs no new allocations per particle
tick. Declarations support linear size/opacity curves and constant gravity/friction; for per-particle
code, register a provider with `register_particle_providers` ("Particle providers"). A provider replaces the
declared motion (its tick moves the particle) but the declared spawn values still seed it.


- the open screen hears of a key press (`screen_key_pressed_pre`) and of each character it types (`screen_char_typed_pre`), as vanilla's `ScreenEvent.KeyPressed.Pre` and `.CharacterTyped.Pre`: the screen, vanilla's key name (`key.keyboard.e`; a key with no name fires nothing), whether the press is an auto-repeat, the character, GLFW's modifier bits (shift 1, control 2, alt 4, super 8), and `screen.mouse` for the pointer. A cancelled press goes no further — no focus move, no Escape-close, no inventory or hotbar key, no typing by the key itself — while its release still arrives and the characters no mod cancelled still reach the text box, as vanilla's separate `charTyped` comes for a cancelled `keyPressed` too. A cancelled character drops only that character and never reaches a text box, and the character hook's `field` is a copy of the focused box whose edits the box takes through its own filter, length limit and responders; control characters (Enter, Backspace, Tab, Delete, Escape, a Control letter) are keys and fire nothing. A key's characters fire after the key has acted, as GLFW's char callback comes after its key callback, so a key that closes the screen (the inventory key) reports no character (the closed screen hears none) and one that moves the focus types into the box it moved to. The input method's committed text fires the character hook too. They fire for the window and the control socket's `key` and `type` (not its `\b` backspace), after the fullscreen, screenshot, debug and narrator keys, never on the connect and loading screens, the prompts, books and sign editors drawn over gameplay, or while a world loads or saves.

- `native_push_player([x, y, z])` on a client, added to the local player's velocity as an explosion's knockback is.

- `data_pack_files(files)`, a native mod's own pack files in the data the server loads: while the tables are assembled (a world's first open, and again on every `/reload`), push `(path, bytes)` and they join that load. `path` is the overlay's key, `<kind>/<namespace>:<path>` without `.json`, over the kinds the tables read: `recipe/mymod:thing`, `tags/mymod:block/thing`, `loot_table/…`, `advancement/…`, `trade_set/…`, `villager_trade/…`, `dialog/…`; a file that isn't JSON is skipped with a warning. Asked once per load on both paths, so it is where a mod recomputes them from its config or the world. Contributed files sit below the world's own data packs: a pack's file for the same path still overrides a mod's, and a later contribution overrides an earlier one.

- Biome colours for client mods, for seasons: `biome_colors(biome, colors)` changes a biome's grass, foliage, dry
  foliage and water tints, asked for every biome when a mod calls `native_refresh_biome_colors()`, which rebuilds the
  loaded terrain with them.
- Hidden blocks for client mods (ore scanners, cutaways): the `block_render_visibility` Part method (`state`, `hidden`)
  makes a state draw nothing: the mesher sees it as air, so its neighbours' faces toward it show and it stops hiding what
  is behind it. Its fluid layer and block entity are hidden too; light, collision and the server are untouched. It is
  asked once per state when the client joins a world and again when a mod calls `refresh_render_visibility()`, which
  remeshes the loaded terrain. Attach it to vanilla blocks with `block_part_tag`. With no part answering, meshing is unchanged.

### Screenshots

`Hooks::screenshot` is the client-thread counterpart of NeoForge 26.3's
`ScreenshotEvent`. It runs with a `ClientHost` after F2's GPU readback and before
any file is written. `event.image` is the in-memory frame (`getImage`): RGBA8,
top to bottom, `width * height * 4` bytes. Change the pixels, or replace the
image, and the normal PNG is that image. A buffer whose length is not
`width * height * 4` writes neither file and shows the translated screenshot
failure line. The HDR copy is not this image; it stays the read-back frame.

Return `Flow::Cancel` to write neither the normal PNG nor its HDR companion.
The chat then shows `event.message` when it is set, and otherwise the translated
cancellation line (`screenshot.failure` with `horizon.screenshot.canceled`).

Change `event.file_name` to a relative path under the player's `screenshots/`
folder (for example `album/view.png`). Missing parent folders are created.
Absolute paths, empty, `.` or `..` components, backslashes, drive prefixes, NUL
and symbolic links, including the HDR destination, are refused with the normal
translated screenshot failure line. The player may make the screenshots folder
itself a symlink. As with other local file operations, this does not isolate a
native mod or defend against a concurrent external filesystem replacement.

`event.message` starts as `None`: after a successful save the game builds the
normal translated, clickable success line using the final file name. Set it to
`Some(Text)` to replace that success line. Save errors always show the failure,
not a listener's success message. A no-op listener preserves ordinary saving.
With HDR enabled the existing tagged 16-bit copy follows the chosen name as
`<stem>-hdr.png`; its encoding and best-effort error handling are unchanged.
The hook does not intercept control-socket captures or automatic world icons.
It adds no tick work; dispatch runs only when an F2 image has been read back.

### Server data reload listeners

Trait mods implement `Hooks::add_server_reload_listeners` (server only), the counterpart of
NeoForge 26.3's `AddServerReloadListenersEvent`. Registration runs on world open, `/reload`
and `/datapack` changes, after pack selection. The `&dyn Host` beside the event gives registry
access at registration, as `AddServerReloadListenersEvent.getRegistryAccess` does. Register an
`Arc<impl ServerReloadListener>`
with a unique `Identifier` and `FileToIdConverter::json("machines")`, or `::new("machines", ".bin")`
for another suffix. The listener's `ServerReloadContext` lists converted IDs and reads their
bytes from `data/*/machines/`, including a mod's packaged files and later selected datapack
overrides. A file `data/other/machines/heavy/press.json` becomes `other:heavy/press`: the directory
and extension are removed, subdirectories preserved, and all namespaces included. It cannot
read assets, other directories, or filesystem paths. Converter directories have no leading or
trailing `/`, or empty, `.` or `..` components. Converter fields and reload-view fields are private.

The prepare context is the pack view only, as vanilla's `ResourceManager`. Like vanilla's
`SimplePreparableReloadListener`, `ServerReloadListener::prepare` parses and validates without
changing live state and returns `<dyn ReloadApply>::new(move || { /* publish parsed state */ })`.
All listeners prepare before **any** apply runs. Do not read another listener's new published
state in prepare: dependencies order both phases but do not remove this barrier. Publication
cannot fail. As vanilla's `SimpleJsonResourceReloadListener.scanDirectory`, a listener that
parses its files logs and skips one that will not parse, carrying the rest through. Returning
`Err` from `prepare` — like any preparation, registration or ordering error — aborts the whole
reload: all pending applies are dropped and the old mod data and vanilla function library are
kept. A panic in `prepare` or an apply is not recovered: it stops the server, and the crash
report names the listener and the mod that registered it. The error names the namespaced
listener and, for file errors, resource ID; world open fails, and `/reload` reports the
failure. A failed `/datapack` change also preserves the selected packs on disk.

`event.listeners.add_dependency(first, second)` orders named listeners. Both names must
already be registered; unknown names fail immediately, and cycles fail after registration.
`VanillaServerListeners::functions()` names Horizon's function-library listener; `first()` and
`last()` are ordering boundaries. These anchors and dependency ends use `Identifier`. Mod
listeners run after vanilla by default, in registration order; an explicit dependency before
`functions()` works without a false cycle. Use these anchors rather than their string values. The read-only `get_registry`,
`get_graph` and `get_last_vanilla_listener` give the registered names, the dependency edges and
the vanilla anchor's name, by value (NeoForge's give the objects; a mod keeps its own listener's
`Arc`, and its name is the one it registered it under). `prepare` returns
`Box<dyn ReloadApply>`; `<dyn ReloadApply>::new(move || ...)` makes one from a closure. Horizon does not expose NeoForge's condition
context here.

`event.listeners.add_retained_listener(&key, converter, listener)` also keeps the listener
object for other hooks, the counterpart of NeoForge's `addRetainedListener(key, listener)`: the
caller builds the typed key — `let key: ListenerKey<MyListener> = ListenerKey::new(id)` — and
reads the object back from any server hook through
`host.reload_resources().listener(&key)` — an `Arc<T>` of the live object the last successful
reload installed, as NeoForge's `ReloadableServerResources.getListener`. Registration rules and
prepare/apply semantics are `add_listener`'s. Retention follows the reload: a new reload
registers fresh objects and the store is replaced whole by the first successful apply, so a key
held across a reload keeps addressing the new object. Before the first successful reload, or
for a key whose id or type does not match a registration, `listener` gives `None`.

```rust,ignore
use std::sync::{Arc, RwLock};

    self, AddServerReloadListenersEvent, FileToIdConverter, Host, Hooks, Identifier,

            None => serde_json::Value::Null,
        };

            FileToIdConverter::json("machines").unwrap(),

        ).unwrap();
    }
}
```

Reload work only: graph ordering, listing selected files, reading the winning bytes and one
boxed apply closure per listener. No new work or filesystem reads run on the tick path.
The existing post-success server-data notice below is a different moment, not a second
reload registration path.

- `tags_updated(cause)` fires once tags changed (NeoForge's `TagsUpdatedEvent`), on both sides. `TagsUpdateCause::ServerDataLoad { reload }` fires once the server's data tables are built: the recipes, tags, loot and advancements of the world's data packs and of `data_pack_files` are what the helpers read from then on. `reload` is false on a world's first open, before its chunks and players are loaded, and true after `/reload`, once the players were sent the new data. `TagsUpdateCause::ClientPacketReceived { integrated_server }` fires on a client once per set of tags from its server: at login, and for every update in play, on the game thread, with the new tags in the tag helpers. It is where a mod drops caches derived from the data and rebinds what depends on it. In single player both fire, each on its own thread; `cause.should_update_static_data()` is false only for an integrated server's client packet, so data the two share is updated once, on the server. A remote client's packet returns true.

### Client asset reload listeners

Trait mods implement `Hooks::add_client_reload_listeners` (client only), the counterpart of
NeoForge 26.3's `AddClientReloadListenersEvent`. Registration runs when a resource reload is
assembled — the player changed resource packs, pressed F3+T, or a server sent its packs —
after the selection is known and before the reload's assets are staged. The `&dyn ClientHost`
beside the event is the client read host. Register an `Arc<impl ClientReloadListener>` with a
unique `Identifier` and the same converters as the server side
(`FileToIdConverter::json("ui")`). The listener's `ClientReloadContext` lists converted IDs and
reads their bytes from `assets/*/ui/` with resource-pack overrides already resolved: a selected
pack's file wins over the mod's packaged one, and a pack added later wins over both. A file
`assets/my_mod/ui/theme.json` becomes `my_mod:theme`. It cannot read data files, other
directories, or filesystem paths. Files resolve like vanilla resource packs: every file
except `lang/*.json` is delivered as the exact bytes of the winning pack's file, while
language files arrive key-wise merged across the packs, as vanilla loads them.

Prepare and apply semantics, error handling, crash attribution, dependency ordering and the
read-only registry views are the [server listener's](#server-data-reload-listeners):
`ClientReloadListener::prepare` parses without changing live state and returns a `ReloadApply`;
all prepares finish before any apply, a prepare, registration or ordering error aborts the
reload and keeps every listener's previous assets, and a panic names the listener and its
registering mod in the crash report. `VanillaClientListeners::model_manager()` names vanilla's
model manager, the anchor of the 26.3 `Minecraft` registration order; `first()` and `last()`
are the ordering boundaries. Mod applies run on the main thread after the staged pack is
published, before `client_resources_reloaded`. Listeners are registered fresh for every
load: the initial resource load registers them once, before any prepare runs (as
NeoForge's construction-time event does — no game exists yet, and a host read during
registration panics), prepares them beside the rest of the load on the loading thread —
the title screen's loader worker or the direct launch, one path — and the game applies
them once it owns the assets; every later reload — F3+T, a pack change, a server's
packs — registers through the game the same way. A listener whose prepare fails on the
initial load leaves the game running without mod reload listeners, logged as a
warning. NeoForge's client event offers no
retained listeners, and Horizon has none: the `Arc` the mod registers with is the listener's
own live state.

Reload work only: graph ordering, listing selected files, reading the winning bytes and one
boxed apply closure per listener. No new work or filesystem reads run on the tick path. The
existing post-success client-resources notice is a different moment, not a second reload
registration path.

- `compute_fov(partial, camera, degrees)` receives the computed world FOV after settings, ordinary FOV effects and zoom, before projection/Nausea. `camera` is its world position and `partial` the interpolation fraction. Mods can narrow or widen the angle; only finite values in 1..=179 degrees are accepted, otherwise the original computed angle is used. It runs for world rendering and near-plane overlays, not just once per frame. Hand/HUD FOV and the title panorama keep their existing paths.

`native_movement_input(forward, strafe, jump, sneak, forward_key, backward_key, left_key, right_key, sprint)` runs on the client each local player tick after input is read and before it is applied. All seven key booleans are independent, including opposing directions. If any direction key changes, the keyboard direction is recalculated (opposites cancel, diagonals normalize), replacing both axis edits and controller input. Otherwise the listener's scalar axes stand; only changed axes update their packet direction flags. Positive strafe is left. With enabled subscribers, final `sprint = true` requests sprint through vanilla eligibility (including food above 6 unless flight is allowed, slow item use and crouching); `false` holds sprint off for this tick, clearing an existing sprint and preventing double-tap sprint. A passive listener therefore also holds sprint off when the raw sprint key is false. With no enabled subscribers, vanilla's sprint latch, double tap, toggle-key and controller behavior are unchanged. Prediction replays the final keys and sprint state without firing this client hook again. The server receives direction flags, not scalar magnitudes, so remote servers may correct modified movement.

- Mobs drawn by client mods: `render_living_pre(entity, draw, hidden, canceled)` is asked each frame for every mob and player in
  view, with its id, kind, custom name and the frame's body and head turns and walk cycle; a mod draws a model of its own with the
  block entity drawing helpers under `draw`'s pose (at the feet, turned with the body) and sets `canceled` to draw nothing else of
  it.

- A screen of a client mod's own: `native_mod_screen_open(mod_id)` opens one over the world (every mod's own screen has the `ScreenView.id` `mod`: check `native_mod_screen()` is yours; it doesn't pause a single-player game; it opens only on the window's own client, over the world with no overlay up; a gamepad can close it but not click on it), the screen hooks fire over it as over any other, so the mod draws it in `screen_render_post` and takes its clicks, scroll, keys and typing from them, and Escape closes it (`native_mod_screen()` says whose is open, `native_mod_screen_close(mod_id)` closes it); and two drawing helpers beside `native_fill`: `native_quad(batch, points, argb)` and `native_item_model(batch, item, model, at, size)`, an icon drawn with another `item_model`.

- `camera_distance(partial, mirrored, entity, distance)` receives the final scaled maximum distance for a third-person camera, before the existing eight visual-shape collision rays shorten it. `entity` is the camera entity view, including optional living scale/distance and mount scale/distance; this covers player and spectator-mob cameras. `mirrored` identifies front-facing third person. Only finite values in 0..=1024 blocks are accepted, keeping mod requests within the collision-ray budget; other values retain the original distance. First-person views and title panoramas do not fire it.

- `compute_fog_color(partial, camera, fog_type, rgb)` adjusts the final world fog RGB after normal biome, weather and effect calculation and before GPU upload. Camera is its world position; fog_type distinguishes atmosphere, water, lava and powder snow. Only finite components in 0..=1 are accepted; invalid requests retain the original RGB. Alpha and all distance fields are unchanged. Title panoramas skip this hook.

- `mouse_button_pre(button, pressed, modifiers, canceled)` sees real button events on any screen, before normal dispatch. Button and modifiers use the screen hooks' GLFW encoding. Physical button bookkeeping already ran. Cancellation skips normal dispatch and Post. Accepted events call `mouse_button_post(button, pressed, modifiers)` after dispatch, including screen handlers' early returns. Synthetic pad/focus clicks skip both hooks. Existing screen-specific hooks remain.

- A player respawning: `player_respawned(player, name)` is heard once at the end of `PlayerList.respawn`, with the player placed and their health, food and experience reset (NeoForge's `PlayerRespawnEvent`), on a server, with their state swapped in so the helpers reach them.
- Where a player respawns (`PlayerRespawnPositionEvent`): `native_player_respawn_position(player, original_level, original_position, missing_respawn_block, level, position, yaw, pitch, copy_original_spawn_position)`, on a server, once the respawn point is found. `player` is the player's handle. The mods may change the level, the position, the facing and whether the fresh player keeps its respawn point (default: yes, unless the bed or anchor was missing). Vanilla finds the point inside `PlayerList.respawn`. Horizon places the player first and finds a bed or anchor's spot, or the world spawn's free column, once its chunks have loaded, so for those the hook fires then, after `player_respawned`. There a new point in the same level is a teleport, and another level is a level change: one extra Respawn packet, heard as `player_teleported`. An Overworld forced point needs no block: the hook fires at once, before the Respawn packet, and a changed level, point or facing is simply where the player respawns. The point the mods choose is not block-checked and the hook doesn't fire again. Not for the End exit, which isn't a respawn here.

- A client mod's view and items: `native_raycast(distance)` and `native_view_hit()` (the first block along the view, up to 1024 blocks, across the distant terrain past the loaded chunks), and `native_claim_items(mod_id, ids)`: a right-click with one of those items is the mod's alone, the server never hears of it, and `native_poll(mod_id)` gives `UseStart` and `UseStop` with the stack (its custom name and data as SNBT) and the ticks it was held.

- `render_fog(partial, camera, fog_type, fog)` adjusts final FogData after normal environment/effect/render-distance calculation and Horizon's fog option, before GPU upload. Title panoramas skip it. The whole request is accepted only when color components are finite in 0..=1, all distances are finite, environmental and render-distance ends exceed their starts, and sky/cloud ends are nonnegative. Negative near planes remain valid (water/lava). Invalid requests retain the original whole fog.

- `screen_key_released_pre(screen, key, modifiers, canceled)` runs before a named key's release reaches an open screen, with the same screen exclusions and GLFW modifier encoding as the existing key-press hook. It does not fire for presses/repeats or unnamed keys. Cancel bypasses screen handling, but physical key removal and mapped keyboard/toggle releases still happen to prevent stuck inputs. Mouse mappings retain their existing gameplay-only gate.

- Music for client mods: `music(music, volume)` changes the track the music manager plays and its volume each
  tick, and `music_layers(layers)` lists looping tracks played over it, each easing to its own volume (stems that
  grow fuller).

- A server's recipes reach its Horizon clients, as NeoForge's `OnDatapackSyncEvent.sendRecipes` and `RecipesReceivedEvent`: on the server, `native_datapack_sync(player, recipe_types)` takes the recipe types (`minecraft:smelting`, `mymod:crusher`) a mod's client half needs, asked once the joining player exists, after admission and before their recipes are sent; `player` is a required `PlayerRef`. Reload asks once per online player, at most once per player per reload, before re-sending their recipes; with nobody online it is not asked. Configuration tags precede admission; Horizon sends their final recipes (data packs merged, load conditions held) to that Horizon client when it joins and after each `/reload`, in payloads within the clientbound cap, and nothing to a vanilla client. On the client the recipe helpers (`native_recipes`, `native_recipes_of_type`) then give the server's recipes of those types in place of the window's own, single player included, and `recipes_received(recipe_types)` says they came. No type asked: nothing is sent and nothing changes; none asked after a load that asked some: the clients go back to their own recipes and `recipes_received` comes with no types.
- `level.recipe_for(host, &recipe_type, &inputs)` matches through the game's crafting, cooking, stonecutting and smithing matchers, including data-pack recipes of those vanilla types. `RecipeInput` has Crafting, Single and Smithing variants. A `RecipeMatch` carries recipe id, typed output, ordered remainders, experience and processing time. Valid non-matching input is `Ok(None)`; malformed input, invalid items and unavailable levels are typed errors. Mod-owned types return `RecipeLookupError::NotMatchable`: cache `recipes_of_type` once per load/reload and match in mod memory, with no per-tick host crossing. Dynamic custom outputs/contextual predicates stay mod-owned. Lookup does not consume inputs; cache the result until the input changes.

- `input_key(key, layout_key, raw_code, action, modifiers)` (version 2) runs after a real window keyboard event finishes handling, including shortcuts, screen consumption and repeats (`InputEvent.Key`). key is vanilla's name for the physical key (`key.keyboard.a`; `key.keyboard.unknown` for one it doesn't name; `getKey`), layout_key its name for the key the layout produced (`getKeycode`: a letter or digit names itself, so AZERTY's key at QWERTY's W is `key.keyboard.z`; a named key keeps the physical name; `None` otherwise), raw_code the platform scan code, or winit's native code for a key it doesn't identify, so unnamed keys stay apart (`getScanCode`; stable within a platform only), action is `KeyAction::Press`, `Repeat` or `Release`, and modifiers use the screen hooks' GLFW bits, captured before handling. Not cancellable. Foreign-window and OS synthetic focus events skip it. Window callback only: pad, focus and control-socket input are not window key events.

- `mouse_scrolling(scroll, accumulated, buttons, cursor, modifiers, canceled)` fires with a player in gameplay and no open screen/prompt/sleeping UI, after accumulation and before hotbar/spectator handling, including when no whole step has accumulated. scroll is x/y after discrete/sensitivity scaling (touchpad pixels normalized by 30), accumulated is the whole x/y pair, buttons are physical left/middle/right, cursor is the GUI position, and modifiers use GLFW bits. Cancel skips gameplay scrolling; accumulated whole steps remain consumed. Synthetic input follows the same gameplay scroll path; screen-scroll hooks are unchanged.

- `screen_mouse_dragged_pre(screen, button, delta, modifiers, canceled)` runs before screen drag handlers for real nonzero pointer movements with a held button. The most recently pressed button is active until it releases; focus loss and splitscreen handoff clear it. Same screen exclusions and GLFW button/modifier encoding as the other screen input hooks. screen.mouse is the new GUI position; delta is movement in GUI pixels. Cancel skips screen drag handlers while retaining the new cursor position. Synthetic input and hover-only moves skip it.

- The screen render stages (`screen_render_pre`, `screen_render_background`, `screen_render_foreground`, then `screen_render_post`) are NeoForge's `ScreenEvent.Render.*`, on the screens `screen_render_post` covers. `Render.Pre` cancel skips the screen's own drawing and with it Background and Foreground; Post still fires. Background fires after the screen's background panel and before its contents; screens with no panel fire it before their contents. Foreground fires after the contents, before tooltips, the dragged stack and the preedit overlay. Lower client renderers report these boundaries to the game, which dispatches with its client host and draw context. `ScreenEvent.Init.Pre` has no hook: Horizon has no screen init method to veto or skip; `screen_opening` (`ScreenEvent.Opening`) is the veto point. With no mod subscribed to any of the four, nothing is built per frame.
- The screen input Post hooks (`screen_mouse_button_pressed_post`, `screen_mouse_button_released_post`, `screen_mouse_dragged_post`, `screen_mouse_scrolled_post`, `screen_key_pressed_post`, `screen_key_released_post`, `screen_char_typed_post`) are NeoForge's `ScreenEvent.*.Post`, on the screens the `_pre` input hooks cover and only when the matching Pre did not cancel. They differ in when they fire. The mouse Posts fire after the screen's own arms ran, handled or not; unlike NeoForge's, the press and release carry no `wasClickHandled`/`wasReleaseHandled`, because Horizon's screens take their input without reporting it. The key and char Posts fire only when no screen arm took the input (vanilla's `keyPressed`/`charTyped` returning false), and their `canceled` marks it handled: a cancelled key press or release never reaches the game's key bindings. The char Post does not fire on Options and the title's own screens, whose text is routed in place. A Post fires on the screen open after the input was handled, so one that closed the screen fires nothing. With no mod subscribed, a Post does no work.

- The preedit hooks (`screen_preedit_pre`, `screen_preedit_post`) are NeoForge's `ScreenEvent.Preedit.Pre` and `.Post`, fired from the window's input method preedit event while a screen is open. Pre cancel bypasses the screen's handler and Post. Horizon's handler is the focused text field taking the composition, and its real result is what gates Post: Post fires only when no text field took the preedit (no constant). An empty `full_text` is a composition that ended. Nothing fires with no subscriber.
- `screen_render_inventory_mob_effects` is `ScreenEvent.RenderInventoryMobEffects`: once a frame in the survival and creative inventories' effect panels, after vanilla's early-outs (no effects, or under 32 GUI pixels free), with `available_space`, `compact` (vanilla's default is under 120) and `horizontal_offset` to change, and cancel to draw nothing. The answer is a screen-build input: the exclusion areas (`screen_exclusion_areas`) follow it in the same frame, with no lag behind a change, and a second build in one frame reuses the frame's answer rather than asking again; no subscriber leaves vanilla's layout.
- `gather_effect_screen_tooltips` is `GatherEffectScreenTooltipsEvent`: fires for every hovered rendered effect panel beside the survival and creative inventories. `tooltip` starts empty when the panel's information is fully visible, or as the full name then duration for a compact panel or a name cut short. A listener can add a tooltip where vanilla has none, or change, reorder or remove lines; an empty list draws nothing. `effect` is the panel's effect (a `ActiveEffect`). It is separate from `screen_render_inventory_mob_effects`, which picks the layout; hidden panels never dispatch. Screen and effect metadata are built only with a subscriber.

- `mod_container_viewers(dimension, pos, viewers, previous)` is heard once each time the number of players with the mod container at `pos` open changes (vanilla's `ContainerOpenersCounter`, as a barrel keeps it): `previous` 0 is `onOpen`, `viewers` 0 is `onClose`, so a block can show itself open while `viewers` is not 0. It is counted every tick from the players' open menus, so a player who leaves without closing (a lost connection, death, another dimension, out of reach, the block gone) is heard too. On a server, with no player's state swapped in.

- Knockback a mod can change or cancel through `native_living_knockback` (NeoForge's `LivingKnockBackEvent`): at the
  start of `LivingEntity.knockback`, on the raw strength, before the entity's knockback resistance takes its share and
  its motion changes, with the hit's level host (its blocks, random and own attachments), the pushed entity's id and
  type (`minecraft:player` for a player), the push's `source` (`HurtSource`, named as `native_living_incoming_damage`
  names a hit's, with the same entity ids left at 0; a goat's ram pushes with `minecraft:mob_attack` and hurts with
  `minecraft:mob_attack_no_aggro`, as in vanilla), the `attacker` (the attacking entity's network id, falling back to a
  known last hurt-by mob, or 0 when unknown) and what it holds (`attacker_main` and `attacker_off`: a player's selected
  and off-hand stacks, a mob's main hand; none when unknown, recorded only while a native mod is loaded), the `entry`
  (`Short` via `knockback(power, x, z)`, else `Full`), the `strength`, the direction (`x`, `z`; vanilla points it at the
  source of a hit, the attacker's side, and the entity is pushed the other way) and a `canceled` flag. A mod may change
  the three numbers or set `canceled`, and the push follows: canceled, the entity's motion is left alone. A `strength`
  of 0 or less after the hook is no push, and a direction too short to tell draws a random one after it, as in vanilla;
  the resistance scales the strength the hook leaves, so a full knockback resistance still stops the push. A value a mod
  leaves that is not a finite number is put back as it was. It fires for the players, mobs and armor stands the game
  knocks back: a hit's own push, a sprinting or Knockback hit, a sweep, a spear, a shield's push on its holder and a
  goat's ram. It does not fire for a sulfur cube with a block that a hit with a causing entity knocks back
  (`SulfurCube.knockback` does not call `super` there), for the pushes vanilla doesn't make with
  `LivingEntity.knockback` (the ender dragon's wings, Punch arrows, explosions, wind charges, a mace smash's area, a
  hoglin's throw), nor yet for the ones Horizon makes another way: the ender dragon's. The hit is in the middle of its
  work: the level host reads and draws random but can't write the entity or the world. It runs on the thread that ticks
  the world (the server thread), so state a mod shares with its render thread hooks needs synchronising.


- `native_edit_blocks(dimension, edit)` for server mods: runs up columns, from a height or a heightmap's, of block states and filters written as commands write them, made at once straight into the chunks of the level being ticked with what `fill ... strict` does for block entities; the chunks changed go to the players whole.

- Column reads for server mods, in the level being ticked: `native_surface_heights(dimension, columns, heightmap)` and `native_read_columns(dimension, columns, heightmap, (below, above))`, the blocks round each column's height as a palette and indexes with the biome's grass, foliage and water tints.

- `experience_orb_can_merge(dimension, into, from, into_value, from_value, can_merge)` is asked for each pair of orbs whose boxes meet, when an orb spawns (`ExperienceOrb.tryMergeToExisting`; `from` is 0, the new orb is no entity yet) and every 20 ticks as an orb scans (`scanForMerges`); `can_merge` holds vanilla's `canMerge` answer, which a mod may flip either way. `experience_orb_merge(dimension, into, from, from_value, canceled)` follows a yes and may cancel it: both orbs stay, and a spawning orb tries the next orb in reach, then spawns on its own. A merged orb counts as `count` orbs of the keeper's value. `native_set_experience_orb(dimension, id, value, count, age)` writes an orb's `value`, `count` and `age` (each optional; false for a `count` of 0 or an orb that isn't there; signed `value` is preserved, including zero and negative values).

- `block_entity` gives a block a block entity whatever its template: a mod's stone casing or thin part can use any template. The engine removes it when its block is broken or replaced, no piston moves it, and a mod that draws it (`block_entity_submit`) is asked for it.

- Slot rules for registered vanilla and mod menu types: `menu_slot_rules` starts with the slot's own answers and may change both, as a NeoForge mod overrides `Slot.mayPlace` and `Slot.getMaxStackSize`.

- An item's use tick and release, as vanilla's `Item.onUseTick` and `releaseUsing` and NeoForge's `LivingEntityUseItemEvent.Tick` and `.Stop`. Each tick of a use, `living_entity_use_item_tick` may change the ticks left: at 0 or less, or on a cancel, the server finishes the use, and an item used on release stays frozen until let go. `on_use_tick` is what a mod's own item does then (cook, charge). When the player lets go early, `living_entity_use_item_stop` may skip the release, and `release_using` acts with the ticks left (a bow-like item shoots by its charge); setting `used` starts the item's cooldown. All four run on both sides, as vanilla's do, and take the using entity, None for a player; the tick and stop take the hand too. Change the world only where this game runs the world, not on a server's client.

- `native_inventory(uuid, kind)`: a player's inventory (`Player`: 41 slots, main, armour, off hand; `Ender`: 27), live when they are on the server, else from their file, never while they log in, are dead, or have their inventory swapped out. Other guests' live inventories remain available during a turn; `native_move_stack((from, kind, slot), expected, (to, kind))`: one stack moved, checked against `expected`, where it fits whole, or nothing moves (at most one side a file, written first); `native_send_map(uuid, map_id, colors)`: a 128 x 128 map picture sent to a player, for a filled map with that `map_id`. What an operator's `/invsee` and a price chart on a map need.

- A loot table's function and condition of a mod's own kind. The entry that names a `type` in a namespace outside `minecraft:` reaches `loot_function(kind, data, ctx, stack)` or `loot_condition(kind, data, ctx, holds)` when the table rolls. The context brings the entity, the damage, the player, the tool, the block, the luck, the biome and a seed from the roll's random. Both hooks answer in the tables the items engine rolls (block drops, entity drops, loot_table, interact_loot), where entity, damage, player and biome are None; the function hook there gets the stack as the main engine's (its item, count, damage, enchantments, potion and saved components) and takes back what it changes, but a function that asks for a map's structure search changes nothing there. An unclaimed function leaves the stack, an unclaimed condition fails, as unknown kinds do.

- A server's levels opening and closing, on the single player server thread and on a dedicated server: `level_load(dimension)` when a level opens, before any of its chunks (NeoForge's `LevelEvent.Load`), and `level_unload(dimension)` once it has closed, after its last save (`LevelEvent.Unload`). The level the world opens in comes before `WorldOpenReady`; the Nether and the End open when someone first goes there and close after 300 ticks with nobody in them. Every level still open closes when the server stops, before `WorldCloseFinal`, or when its open or its loop fails, so each load has one unload.

- The client's level made and dropped, on the window: `client_level_load(dimension)` when the client makes a level, on joining a server (single player's own included) and on changing dimension (NeoForge's `LevelEvent.Load` from the `ClientLevel` constructor), and `client_level_unload(dimension)` when it drops one, replaced by another dimension's (told after the new one's load, as `Minecraft.setLevel` does) or on leaving the server (`LevelEvent.Unload`). Each load has one unload, except when the game itself quits.

- A projectile's impact, which a mod can cancel, through `native_projectile_impact` (NeoForge's `ProjectileImpactEvent`): it fires when a projectile has found what it meets, before the hit acts, with the projectile's id, type (`minecraft:arrow`) and owner, the level, and what it hit: an entity (its id and type) or a block (its position and the face's normal) and the point. Set `canceled` and the impact does not happen: no damage, knockback, sound or block reaction, an arrow does not stick, a pearl does not teleport, a potion or a fireball does not burst. The projectile flies on and is not discarded, so a mod that cancels decides what becomes of it. It covers arrows, tridents, thrown items, fireballs, wither skulls, wind charges, llama spit and shulker bullets, on the single player server thread and on a dedicated server. It does not fire for a breeze's deflection, a hit on a wind charge, fireworks or fishing bobbers. A mod hooks `hears_projectile_impacts(hears)` too and sets `hears`: without it the server keeps no copy of its flying projectiles and the impact hook is not called.

- An entity getting on or off a vehicle, which a mod can cancel, through `native_entity_mount` (NeoForge's `EntityMountEvent`): the rider's id and type, the vehicle's id and type, whether it is mounting, and a `canceled` flag. Cancellation keeps the relationship even when a boat or cart is destroyed; the removed vehicle is no longer a valid handle or selector result. A resident Mob retries before its next eligible entity tick, after the tick's cancellable Pre event; a server player retries on its next vehicle tick. A rejected, nonresident passenger does not autonomously retry. Explicit later dismounts ask again. Loading a save does not notify. On the single player server thread and on a dedicated server.

- `interaction_key_mapping_triggered(key, hand, attempt, swing_hand, canceled)` fires while playing when an interaction key is about to act on the crosshair (NeoForge's `InputEvent.InteractionKeyMappingTriggered`): `key` is `InteractionKey::Attack` (when an attack is allowed, and each tick a held key keeps digging a block), `Use` (once for each hand tried, main first, before the hand's target and item) or `PickBlock` (only with a block or entity aimed at). `attempt` distinguishes a queued press from a held mapping. Set `canceled` to skip the action; a cancelled use ends the click, so the other hand gets no turn. Attack and use honour `swing_hand` (true on entry) as a swing request independently of cancellation: false suppresses natural swing requests, cancellation with true requests a swing without acting, and uncancelled true preserves natural no-swing outcomes. A request does not guarantee a new animation: an item can veto it, and an animation already in progress can prevent a new swing from starting during held mining. Pick only vetoes its packet and never requests a swing. The window client on any server, including single player.

- `key_mapping_pre(mapping, pressed, canceled)` is asked while playing, before the game acts on a physical key or mouse button bound to a gameplay mapping (`key.jump`, `key.attack`...), once for each mapping bound to it. `pressed` is true for a press (a key's repeats too) and false for its release. Set `canceled` on a press to drop it for every mapping bound to that input: the mapping is not held, nothing acts on it, and a mouse press is not counted as a click. A cancel on a release is ignored, so what the game holds is always let go. A release is asked too, while playing: a screen that opens lets go of what it holds without asking. A key bound to two mappings (forward and sprint) is canceled as one. It is asked for the window's keys and mouse buttons, agent control's included, after the window's own shortcuts (fullscreen, screenshot, debug keys) and with no screen open. A controller's presses are not asked.

- `gui_layer_pre(layer, batch, canceled)` and `gui_layer_post(layer, batch)` fire around each vanilla HUD layer Horizon draws, in its paint order, so a mod places its own drawing below a layer (in `pre`) or above it (in `post`), NeoForge's `RegisterGuiLayersEvent` registerBelow/registerAbove, and hides a layer by setting `canceled` in `pre` (`RenderGuiLayerEvent.Pre`). Layer ids: `minecraft:crosshair`, `hotbar`, `effects`, `boss_overlay`, `vehicle_health` (riding a mount), `contextual_info_bar` (the jump bar, locator bar or experience bar with the level number), `player_health` (health, armor, food and air rows, one pass), `selected_item_name`, `sleep_overlay`, `overlay_message` (action bar), `title`, `scoreboard_sidebar`, `subtitle_overlay`, `chat` (the unfocused lines) and `tab_list`. F1 hides the layers it hides in vanilla, and then nothing fires for them. The camera overlays (drawn by the screen-effects pass) and the debug screen are not layers. A hidden layer still runs its game logic (the health rows' blink, the bubble pop sound) and `post` still fires.

- `map_decorations(map, decorations)` is asked each time a map is drawn (held, in an item frame, or on the cartography table's screen) with `MapInfo` (id, centre block, scale, dimension, locked, whether it is in a frame); push `MapDecoration { sprite, x, y, rot, shown_on_frame }` (an atlas sprite, a position in half map pixels from -128 to 127, a rotation 0 to 15, and whether it shows in frames and on the screen like vanilla's markers) and it is drawn after the vanilla decorations with the same pose; a sprite the atlas lacks is left out. Nothing is saved in the map and vanilla's decorations are not passed in. This is the client half of NeoForge's `MapDecorationType`; types registered on the server and saved in map data need code-side registration.

- A player's client starting and stopping tracking an entity, on the single player server thread and on a dedicated server: `player_start_tracking(player, name, entity, uuid, kind)` when the entity is sent to the player (NeoForge's `PlayerEvent.StartTracking`, vanilla's `ServerEntity.addPairing`) and `player_stop_tracking(...)` when it stops (`PlayerEvent.StopTracking`, `removePairing`): out of range, gone from the level, or the player left, changed level or respawned. They name the entity by ID, UUID and type and run with no player's state swapped in, so a mod sends what the player needs with `PlayerRef::send_payload`. Each start has one stop.

- An energy buffer on a mod block's block entity. `r.block_energy(&block, buffer)` registers a `ModEnergyBuffer` as `SimpleEnergyHandler` is built: its capacity, the most one insert and one extract moves, and the faces a fill may come through and a drain may leave by. The amount lives in the entity's saved compound as the int `energy`, so it survives restarts and the block's own tick reads it there. The game's own energy capability and registration-time type coverage share that declaration (see "A block's energy").

- Data maps (`RegisterDataMapTypesEvent`). `native_data_map_types(types)` pushes the types a mod registers: an `id` (`mod_id:name`, not in `minecraft`) for a `registry`, any the game names; asked once per load of the server's data (a world's first open and every `/reload`). The values come from `data/<mod_id>/data_maps/<registry folder>/<name>.json` (the registry's path for a `minecraft` registry, `<namespace>/<path>` otherwise) in the world's data packs and from files a mod pushes through `native_data_pack_files` under the key `data_maps/<mod_id>:<registry folder>/<name>`: `{"replace": false, "values": {"minecraft:coal": ..., "#minecraft:logs": ...}, "remove": [...]}`, an entry's value being the data itself or `{"value": ..., "replace": false}`, optionally with its own `neoforge:conditions`; an id the registry doesn't hold is skipped with one warning per file; `replace` clears what earlier files set, a tag gives every entry in it the value, `remove` applies after the file's own values, and a newer value overrides an older one. A typed map (`DataMap`: its id, its entries' registry and how a value decodes) is pushed with `DataMap::ty`, and a key's `data(host, &map)` (`ItemKey`, `BlockKey`, `FluidKey`, `EffectKey`, `EntityTypeKey`, `EnchantmentKey`, `BlockEntityTypeKey`, `ProfessionKey`) reads an entry's merged value, `data_map_value(host, registry, entry, map)` the same by name and `data_map_entries(host, registry, map)` the whole map, `Ok(None)` where it has none and a `DataMapError` where no maps are loaded, no mod registered the map or the value does not decode. Server side only and not synced to clients; mergers are not here yet. `native_data_maps_updated(registry, cause)` (NeoForge's `DataMapsUpdatedEvent`) fires once for each registry that has a type, in registry id order, right after `native_tags_updated`'s `ServerDataLoad`, on a world's first open and after every `/reload`, with `DataMapsUpdateCause::ServerReload`: the place to build caches from the new values. `DataMapsUpdateCause::ClientSync` is for a client applying synced data maps, which does not exist yet.

`living_fall(context, entity, kind, distance, multiplier, cancel)` corresponds to NeoForge's `LivingFallEvent` at `LivingEntity.causeFallDamage`. Mods may change the distance and damage multiplier or cancel fall handling; cancellation does not reverse physical movement. This free function receives the entity ID and type and cannot call game helpers. Player landings, mounted player falls and non-equine mob falls are wired. Equines use their own fall-damage override rather than `LivingEntity.causeFallDamage`. `context` is the loop context of the side that ticks the entity; the hook fires inside the landing, so it takes no `Host` (a deferred call would reorder the fall damage and block effects). `farmland_trample` and `ender_entity_teleport` take the context the same way, and so does `living_jump`, which fires inside the jump. Contract version `2` for all four: a mod written for `1` takes the context as a new first argument of the `Hooks` method.

`living_jump(context, entity, kind)` listens for NeoForge's `LivingEvent.LivingJumpEvent` after a living entity jumps. It receives the entity ID and type, and cannot cancel or change the jump. The player motion and mob ground-jump paths, including cubes and ridden horses and camels, are wired; whether every client-side prediction path reaches them remains unverified.

`living_heal(context, entity, amount, cancel)` corresponds to NeoForge's `LivingHealEvent` at `LivingEntity.heal`. The amount can be changed and cancellation prevents the heal. It covers player effect, food and peaceful regeneration healing and the wired mob healing paths. Other healing paths and client-side coverage remain unverified. `entity` is the affected player or mob ID. `context` is the loop context of the side that ticks the entity; the hook fires inside the health update, so it takes no `Host` (a deferred call would reorder vanilla's regeneration timers). Contract version `2`: a mod written for `1` takes the context as a new first argument of the `Hooks` method.

`living_drown(context, entity, kind, is_drowning, damage_amount, bubble_count, cancel)` asks on the server when a player or mob cannot breathe and has no air (NeoForge's `LivingDrownEvent`, `LivingEntity.baseTick`); water animals, axolotls and nautiluses are asked too, from their own air logic, and show no bubbles. Mods may change the drowning decision, damage and bubble count, or cancel. Damage at or below zero does not hurt. The normal eight bubbles use the entity event; other positive counts are sent in a particle packet, and nonpositive counts suppress bubbles.

- A player's or mob's breathing, on the single player server thread and on a dedicated server: `living_breathe(context, entity, kind, can_breathe, consume, refill)` every tick for a player and for a mob (NeoForge's `LivingBreatheEvent`, vanilla's `LivingEntity.baseTick`), with Horizon's answers as the defaults: set `can_breathe` and how much air `consume` takes or `refill` gives (up to 300); at -20 the entity is set to 0 air and takes 2 drowning damage. It is a free function in `horizon_client::breathing`, so it answers and cannot call helpers. Axolotls, nautiluses and `WaterAnimal`s are asked with their own air logic's answers (full air where they breathe, 1 lost elsewhere) and dry out or drown at -20 by it.

- Blocks and items a native mod declares in code, as NeoForge's `DeferredRegister.Blocks` and `.Items` drained by `RegisterEvent`, instead of one content file each: `blocks(context, blocks)` and `items(context, items)`, asked once at start on every side, take `mod_api::Block` and `Item`, the declarations a content mod's `data/<id>/horizon/block/` and `item/` files hold (a vanilla template and what differs; a block has its item unless `item` is false, in code as in a file). Ids are in the mod's namespace. They join the content mods' blocks and items, inside the content mod whose id is that namespace when it is on (its models, textures, loot and recipes), else on their own with the template's look, so their network ids, saves and the joining client's content check are the files' (docs/mods.md). They pass the files' checks; a namespace whose declarations don't is logged and left out.

- Entities ticking, through `entity_tick_pre` (NeoForge's `EntityTickEvent.Pre`) and `entity_tick_post` (`EntityTickEvent.Post`), with the entity's id and type (`minecraft:zombie`, `minecraft:item`) and the level. Set `canceled` in the Pre and the entity doesn't tick this tick (and its Post isn't told). Told for the mobs, item entities, minecarts and boats that tick in an entity-ticking chunk, on the single player server thread and on a dedicated server; not for a player's own boat or minecart, projectiles, orbs, primed TNT, falling blocks or armor stands. Check `kind`. Mobs and items hear every Pre before the family's first tick and every Post after its last; minecarts and boats hear theirs around each one's tick. A mod that hooks them also hooks `entity_tick_listened(listened)` and sets `*listened = true`: otherwise no entity's tick is told. It runs each tick for every ticking entity, so keep it cheap.

- A mob's, an armor stand's or a player's equipment changing, on the single player server thread and on a dedicated server: `living_equipment_change(entity, kind, slot, from, to)` once for each slot (`mainhand`, `offhand`, `feet`, `legs`, `chest`, `head`, `body`, `saddle`) that holds another stack than the mods last heard (NeoForge's `LivingEquipmentChangeEvent`, vanilla's `LivingEntity.collectEquipmentChanges`). A mob new to the level counts from empty on its first tick. A mod that hooks it also hooks `living_equipment_listened(listened)` and sets `*listened = true`: otherwise the game does not read every mob's and connected player's equipment each tick, and only armor stands are told. Players connected to the server (a dedicated server's, a published world's guests) are told the same way with `kind` `minecraft:player`, for their six slots `mainhand` (the selected hotbar slot, so a hotbar selection counts), `offhand`, `feet`, `legs`, `chest` and `head`; their `body` and `saddle` are never told. The world host's own player isn't told here: `on_equip` hears it. It only hears.

- `render_player_pre(player, who, draw, hidden, canceled)` fires once a frame for each other player in view and for this window's player in third person, before its `render_living_pre`, with the same frame (`MobRender`, a `BlockEntityDraw` at the feet turned with the body) and `who` (profile name, whether it is the local player); set `canceled` to draw nothing of the player this frame (`RenderPlayerEvent.Pre`). `render_living_post(entity, parts, draw)` and then, for a player, `render_player_post(player, who, parts, draw)` fire once a frame after the vanilla model and layers of every mob and player in view whose pre hooks weren't canceled (but a player whose `render_living_pre` alone was canceled still gets `render_player_post`, with no parts), and what the mod adds in that frame is drawn with it (`RenderLivingEvent.Post`, `RenderPlayerEvent.Post`; layers of one type's renderer are `register_entity_layers`, `EntityRenderersEvent.AddLayers`). Geometry attaches to the entity's frame, not to the model's bones: head yaw, pitch and the walk cycle are in `MobRender`. The game asks once a frame whether any mod listens to the four, and with none builds nothing for them.

- A player finishing a sign: `native_sign_changed(player, name, dimension, pos, front, lines, cancel)` is heard when a player sends the text they wrote on a sign they were editing, right before it goes on the sign, once the checks have passed, on a server, with the player's state swapped in (`PlayerRef::tell` reaches them). A mod may rewrite `lines` (four lines of plain text) or set `cancel` so the sign keeps its old text; a waxed sign is not told.

- Models no blockstate names, as NeoForge's `ModelEvent.RegisterStandalone`: `standalone_models(context, event)` contract version 2, asked once at client startup (not on integrated or dedicated servers), retains plain ids in `event.models` and adds `event.forms: Vec<StandaloneModelForm>`. `Rotated { id, model, turns, uvlock }` bakes a source using centered negative XYZ quarter-turns and real inverse-face UV locking; `Combined { id, parts }` concatenates dependencies' baked quads into one result. Missing dependencies drop the entire form and log the registering mod, not the source namespace. Result ids follow the plain-id namespace rule. Every resource load rebakes both from current files. Resolve each result's `Identifier` through `host.render_assets().model(&id)` in `model_baking_completed`, retaining its opaque `ModelRef` between frames. `BlockEntityDrawContext::model(model, tint)` consumes that handle under the draw pose in `block_entity_submit` or `render_living_pre`, with `tint` (`0xAARRGGBB`) on tinted faces, alpha included; use `0xFFFFFFFF` for no tint. Missing or unbaked names return `ModelError::UnknownModel`. Successful resource replacement invalidates old handles with `ModelError::StaleModel`; failed reloads keep them usable. Drawing errors append no geometry. Native and wasm share this contract; lookup never reads or bakes files, and results are quads rather than arbitrary mod-defined baked types.

- A player opening and closing any menu on a server, on the single player server thread and on a dedicated server: `player_container_open(player, name, dimension, menu, pos)` and `player_container_close(...)` (NeoForge's `PlayerContainerEvent.Open` and `.Close`), with the menu type's name and, for a block's menu, its position. They run with the player's state swapped in. Unlike the viewer count of a mod container (`mod_container_viewers`) they name the player and cover every menu: chests, furnaces, crafting tables, trades, a mod's own. The open is heard synchronously after construction, the open packet is queued and full contents sent, with the new menu already current; failed construction and the player's own inventory are excluded. Even inside one tick, open precedes close; replacement closes the old menu before the new open. Each open has one close, also when the player leaves. The timing change does not bump `hook_version`: the signature is unchanged.

- A player starting or stopping flight: `player_toggle_flight(player, name, flying, cancel)` is heard once for each change a player's client makes to its flying (vanilla honours it only for a player who may fly), on a server, with the player's state swapped in. A mod sets `cancel` to refuse it: the player keeps the state they had and the server sends their abilities back, so the client lands or flies again. Only what a client asks for is heard, not the flight a game-mode change starts or ends, and not a LAN host's own player.

- `native_physical_window_size()`, the window's width and height in physical pixels, independent of GUI scale. It returns no size on a server or when no window exists.


- a player changing dimension: `player_changed_dimension(player, name, from, to)` is heard once per move of a server's player into another level, when the move has ended (a portal's exit found and the player standing there, a command's teleport landed, a respawn in another level placed for good), with `from` and `to` as dimension ids (`minecraft:overworld`, `minecraft:the_nether`, `minecraft:the_end`) and the player's state swapped in so that `PlayerRef::tell` and the other helpers reach them. A move within a level is not heard.

- `pickup_xp(player, dimension, orb, value, count, canceled)` runs before a server player takes an orb; with no listener the server skips swapping a guest in for it (the shared `listened` probe). Canceling leaves the orb and the pickup delay unchanged; otherwise the signed value is preserved, including zero and negative values, and the count is clamped to at least one, then one count is taken. It runs on the integrated and the dedicated server, guests included.

- Whom an experience orb follows (`XpOrbTargetingEvent`): `xp_orb_targeting(orb, scan_distance, following)`, on a server, for each orb as it ticks. `following` starts as the nearest living player within `scan_distance` (8) blocks who isn't a spectator, or `None`; set another player, or `None` to follow no one. The orb goes only for a living player who isn't a spectator and is in its level, and moves only once they are within 8 blocks. An orb that follows no one gets vanilla's push out of a block it is stuck in. Horizon looks for the nearest player on every orb tick, where vanilla keeps the player it follows while they stay within 8 blocks, so the hook is asked every tick for each orb. Clients still predict the orb's flight towards the nearest player; the server's position wins.

- Where a loot roll happens, for a mod's own loot kinds: `ctx.place` in `loot_function` and
  `loot_condition` brings `LootContextParams.ORIGIN` (a broken block's centre, a dead mob's position), `BLOCK_ENTITY` (the broken
  block's entity as it was, saved with its id, position and `Items`) and the level (its dimension, game time, time of day, rain and
  thunder), on a block broken by a player or an explosion and on a mob's death loot; None on the other rolls. The game sets it
  around a roll with `with_native_loot_place`.

- How a mod block burns, and whether it makes a campfire over it a signal fire, on an authoritative server. `fire_odds(dimension, state, pos, face, odds)` answers
  `FireBlock`'s flammability table (`FireBlock.setFlammable(block, igniteOdds, burnOdds)`) before vanilla's table, for the block at `pos` seen from its side `face` (the one facing the fire, or the air fire may take): put
  `(ignite, burn)` in `odds` for your own blocks. Ignite odds above zero let fire stand beside the block and spread
  to the air around it (planks 5, wool 30), so a face with ignite odds of zero isn't flammable; burn odds are how fast fire destroys it (planks 20, wool 60); `(0, 0)` never
  burns; negative answers become zero, burn odds cap at 300 and spread arithmetic saturates. A waterlogged state never burns and isn't asked. It runs hundreds of times per fire tick: keep it short. `is_fire_source`, `ignited_by_lava` and `on_caught_fire` are the block's other fire questions.
  `smoke_source(dimension, state, smoke)` answers `CampfireBlock.isSmokeSource` for the block under a campfire,
  as the campfire is placed or that block changes: `Some(true)` makes the campfire a signal fire, as a hay bale does.
  Answer only for your own blocks and leave the answer empty otherwise; the level is read-only. The deprecated in-frame
  path fires neither.

- A server player's game mode about to change: `Hooks::player_game_mode_changed` receives a `PlayerGameModeChangedEvent` before the change (NeoForge's `PlayerChangeGameModeEvent`) for the `/gamemode` command, the F3+F4 switcher and a hardcore world's respawn into spectator, once for each change to a different mode, on a server; not for the default mode a player joins with. Its `from` and `to` are `GameMode` values, the same type used by command parsing and `PlayerRef::game_mode`, `set_game_mode` and `previous_game_mode`. Write `*event.to` to redirect the change, or return `Flow::Cancel` to keep the old mode; numeric ids are only for network and save boundaries.

- The server's difficulty changed, from one of `peaceful`, `easy`, `normal`, `hard` to another, through `difficulty_changed` (NeoForge's `DifficultyChangeEvent`). It is vanilla's `MinecraftServer.setDifficulty`, which `/difficulty`, a dedicated server's management and a test environment's difficulty all go through, and it is told only when the difficulty is another one. It only hears: the change has already happened.

- A player's fishing rod: `player_fish(player, name, state, cancel)` is heard for the cast (`state` 0), a fish biting (1), the reel-in with a catch (2), the reel-in with nothing on the line (3) and the reel-in of a bobber hooked to an entity or item (4), for a player of a server (Bukkit's `PlayerFishEvent`; not NeoForge's `ItemFishedEvent`). A mod sets `cancel` to stop a cast, make the fish get away, or leave the bobber out on a reel-in. The player's state is swapped in.

- A player took a crafting grid's result, through `item_crafted` (NeoForge's `PlayerEvent.ItemCraftedEvent`): the player's uuid, the recipe the grid matched (`minecraft:oak_planks`), the result stack it took, with its components, and the grid's cells row by row before the take used them. It only hears; the take has already happened. It fires for the crafting grid of an inventory or a crafting table, on the integrated server and on a dedicated server, guests included, and not for a stonecutter's, a smithing table's or a furnace's result.

- `native_server_event(name, uuid, message)` posts an `announce` event to a dedicated server's event stream (`GET /api/v1/events`); horizon-server's Discord bridge relays it, in gold, when `[discord] events` lists `announce` (off by default). False elsewhere and for an empty message.

- `native_state_block(state)` names the block a state belongs to (`BlockState.getBlock()`), on a server hook's level and on the game: `state_for_placement` is asked for every block placed, so a mod compares it with its own block to answer only for it.

- The helper `native_physical_window_size()`, which returns the window's width and height in physical pixels, independent of GUI scale. It returns no size on a server or when no window exists.

- A recipe ingredient of a mod's own kind. The ingredient entry that names a type in a namespace outside minecraft: reaches ingredient(context, kind, data, items) at load time. Fill items with the item ids the ingredient matches (item ids only: components are checked by the separate `ingredient_test` hook at match time). Duplicates are removed keeping first-seen order. The hook gets the `DataLoadContext` of the load that parses the recipes and hears each occurrence of the kind once per load, nested ones and ones under any slot a recipe reads an ingredient from included, before the load's tables parse the recipes: the client's own recipe load has `origin()` `ClientPreload`, the server's `ServerDataLoad`. A server loads its recipes once however many tables and copies read them (its recipe tables, the stations and the copy synchronised to guests, on a dedicated server too), and a `/reload` asks again once; a client that only joins a remote server is never told `ServerDataLoad`. The answer must be the same every time. An unclaimed kind leaves the list empty and the recipe fails.

- A frame's two moments, as NeoForge's `RenderFrameEvent.Pre` and `.Post`: `render_frame_pre(host, event)` runs once a frame (in a world or not) after Horizon's extras and just before the frame is rendered, and `render_frame_post` right after it was rendered; both carry the frame's time as `event.elapsed`, `world_partial_tick` (captured world interpolation, held while paused or frozen), and `partial_tick` (advancing window interpolation). Outside a world both use the window clock. Pre reports the value about to be drawn; post retains the same snapshot even if a listener changes the clock or screen. Client side; a frame with no listener costs one branch.
- Items a mod's own recipe type takes in a station slot. `recipe_property_sets(context, additions)` is asked once per load, after the recipes are resolved, with the `DataLoadContext` of the load that owns them (`origin()` `ServerDataLoad` on a server, `ClientPreload` on a client's own load), and again after `/reload`. Push one `RecipePropertyAddition::new(set, items)` per set to add to (`minecraft:furnace_input`, `blast_furnace_input`, `smoker_input`, `campfire_input`, `smithing_template`, `smithing_base`, `smithing_addition`, `brewing_input`, `brewing_reagent`); the vanilla recipes' items stay in. The furnace shift-click, the smithing and brewing slots and the set a client is sent read the one answer, so the client predicts what the server accepts. A new key in the listener's manifest-owned namespaces creates a custom set, synchronized to clients alongside vanilla sets. Later listeners may extend an existing set. `Host::mod_recipe_property_contains` and the same `LoopContext` query take the set key and an `ItemKey`; a mod menu's `menu_slot_rules` reads that generation for both server acceptance and client prediction. These queries cover mod-created sets only, returning false for unknown or vanilla keys. Invalid keys, new foreign keys, unknown vanilla keys and air are logged and skipped; an item the registry does not know is ignored. The answer must be the same every time.

- The in-world HUD's two moments, as NeoForge's `RenderGuiEvent.Pre` and `.Post`: `render_gui_pre(host, event)` runs once a frame in a world, before any vanilla HUD layer, and a mod that returns `Flow::Cancel` hides the whole HUD as F1 does (no layer, no `gui_layer_pre` or `gui_layer_post`, no `render_gui_post`, no chat or toasts); it is not heard under F1 or while a server dialog or the connection screen covers the window. `render_gui_post(host, draw, corners)` is the old `hud` hook, unchanged: it draws after the minimap, so a mod that implemented `hud` implements `render_gui_post`. Client side; a frame with no listener costs one branch each.
- Lowering the frame rate limit: `framerate_limit(focused, minimized, in_world, limit)` is asked each frame with the limit Horizon is about to use (Max Framerate after the inactivity throttle and Battery Mode, 260 for unlimited), whether the window has focus, whether it is minimised and whether a world is open. A mod may lower `limit`, for example to throttle a window in the background as Dynamic FPS does; Horizon keeps the lower of its own limit and the mod's and ignores values below 1.
- The camera type F5 cycles to: `camera_type_cycle(host, event)` runs when `key.togglePerspective` cycles the window's
  camera type (`Minecraft.handleKeybinds`), with `previous` and vanilla's `next` (first person, third person behind, third
  person in front); a mod may set `next` to skip or keep a type, and the camera entity's post effect follows the answer.
  `camera_type()` reads the type and `set_camera_type(type)` sets it as F5 does, without a cycle, for a freelook mod that
  switches to third person and back; with `camera_pose` moving the drawn camera, that is a camera independent of the
  player. The game's two copies of `CameraType` are now one, `mod_api::CameraType`. Client side.

- A client tick's two moments, as NeoForge's `ClientTickEvent.Pre` and `.Post`: `client_tick_pre(host, event)` runs at the start of every client tick (`Minecraft.tick`), paused or not and on the title screen too, and `client_tick_post` at its end. They replace the single `tick` hook, which also fired on a server's own `Game`: the server's tick is `server_tick` (`ServerTickEvent`), so a mod that implemented `tick` implements `client_tick_pre` and, for a server, `server_tick`. Window only, client side; a tick with no listener costs one branch.
- How long a client tick lasts, a "timer": `tick_target_millis(host, event)` gets the milliseconds the window's
  `DeltaTracker.Timer` divides each frame's time by (`Minecraft.getTickTargetMillis`), vanilla's 50 at 20 ticks a
  second or the server's slower `/tick rate`, and may set another, once a frame before that frame's client ticks run.
  25 runs the client twice as fast, 100 half as fast, still at most ten ticks a frame; an answer that is not a finite
  number above zero keeps vanilla's. Only the window's clock changes; a server keeps its own rate. Client side; with no
  listener, one branch a frame.

- A player swapping their main and off hand items: version 2 of `player_swap_hands(player, name, to_main_hand, to_off_hand, cancel)` is heard before the swap (a swap from an open inventory is not heard), for a player of a server who is not a spectator, with their state swapped in. A mod may replace the stack each hand gets, or set `cancel` to keep the items where they are; the player's client is sent both slots again. Named injections must request `hook_version = 2`.

- A player's food level changing: `food_level_changed(player, name, from, to, cancel)` is heard for a player of a server when a turn of theirs changed it (eating, hunger and saturation effects, exhaustion, starving; Bukkit's `FoodLevelChangeEvent`), before the new level reaches them. A mod changes `to` or sets `cancel` to leave the level at `from`.

- A server player teleported: `player_teleported(player, name, from, to, dimension)` is heard after `/tp` or `/teleport` has moved a player inside their level or into another one (NeoForge's `EntityTeleportEvent`), with their state swapped in. `from` and `to` are their feet before and after, `dimension` the level they are in now. It cannot stop the move; ender pearls, chorus fruit and a spectator's teleport menu are not heard yet, portals and respawns are not teleports here.

- The command tree a server sends a player: `player_commands_sent(player, name, names)` is heard when a player joins and when their permission level changes, with the root command names their client would get. For a player already on their state is swapped in. A mod removes names and that client's tree is sent without them (its chat box neither completes nor colours them); a typed command still runs, `player_command` stops it.

- A joining player the mods may refuse: `player_login(player, name, cancel, reason)` is heard once for each player a server has accepted (name, whitelist, bans and player limit checked), before their saved state is loaded and before they are placed in a level (NeoForge's `PlayerNegotiationEvent`). A mod sets `cancel` to disconnect them with `reason` ("Disconnected" when it stays unset); no join message and no `player_logged_in` follow.

- A server player's sprint: `player_sprint(player, name, sprinting)` is heard once each time a player's client starts or stops sprinting (the sprint key, a double tap forward, letting go) and the server's player has taken it, with their state swapped in. It only hears what the client asks: a sprint that ends by itself (knockback, hunger, a wall) is not reported.

- A resource pack answer: `resource_pack_status(player, name, status)` is heard when a server player's client answers a resource pack in play (`status` is `ServerboundResourcePackPacket.Action`'s number: 0 loaded, 1 declined, 2 failed download, 3 accepted, 4 downloaded, 5 invalid URL, 6 failed reload, 7 discarded), with their state swapped in. The pack offered during the configuration is answered before the player has joined and is not heard.

- A player taking an item from or putting one on an armor stand: `armor_stand_manipulate(player, name, stand_id, slot, cancel)` is heard after the stand's disabled-slot checks and before anything moves, with the stand's entity id and the slot the click reached (`mainhand`, `offhand`, `feet`, `legs`, `chest`, `head`), on a server, with the player's state swapped in. A mod sets `cancel` and neither the stand nor the player's hand changes.

- A player opening one of the game's own menus: `container_opened(player, name, kind, pos, cancel)` is heard when a chest, furnace, crafting table, villager, anvil, lectern, horse inventory... is about to open (the job of NeoForge's `PlayerContainerEvent.Open`, but before the menu opens), after the checks that refuse it, with the menu type and the block's position, on a server, with the player's state swapped in. A mod sets `cancel` and nothing opens. Menus a mod opens (`native_open_menu`) are not heard.

- A creative player setting a slot: `creative_slot(player, name, slot, item, count, cancel)` is heard when the creative screen sets an inventory slot, or throws a stack out (a slot below 0), after the packet passed vanilla's checks and before the slot changes, on a server, with the player's state swapped in. A mod sets `cancel` and the packet is ignored.

- A boat or minecart moving: `vehicle_moved(player, kind, from, to)` is heard once a tick for each boat or minecart that carries a server player (and for one a server player left, for ten seconds after it stood still), with the vehicle's type and its position before and after (`VehicleMoveEvent`), on a server, with the rider's state swapped in. `player` is the rider's UUID, none for a vehicle that carries nobody now. It only hears.

- A server player emptying a bucket: `bucket_empty(player, name, pos, fluid, cancel)` is heard right before the fluid is placed, once the player may build there. A mod sets `cancel` and nothing is poured. The player's state is swapped in, so the helpers reach them. `fill_bucket` hears the same click without the player and the fluid; dispensers and cauldrons are not heard.

- A server player placing a hanging entity: `hanging_place(player, name, kind, pos, cancel)` is heard for an item frame, a glow item frame, a painting and a leash knot (a lead tied to a fence that has none), once it fits and before it is placed or the item used. A mod sets `cancel` and nothing is placed. The player's state is swapped in, so `PlayerRef::tell` answers them.

- TNT about to be primed: `tnt_primed(player, pos, cancel)` is heard before a flint and steel, a fire charge, fire, a redstone signal, an arrow or a dispenser lights the TNT at `pos`, with the player whose click lit it (None when no player did). A mod sets `cancel` and it is not primed: the block stays, or is put back when fire or a signal had already taken it out. The clicking player's state is swapped in. TNT set off by a blast, a TNT minecart and a sulfur cube are not asked.

- A totem saving a player: `player_totem(player, name)` is heard for a server player whose hurt would have killed them and whose totem fired (`LivingEntity.checkTotemDeathProtection`, Bukkit's `EntityResurrectEvent`), just before the totem is used up. Listen only. The player's state is swapped in.

- `anvil_damaged(dimension, pos, from, to)` runs after an anvil at `pos` changes from `from` to `to`; `to` is air when it broke.

- `block_form(dimension, pos, from, to, cancel)` runs when precipitation is about to place ice or snow, or add a snow layer at `pos`. `from` and `to` are block state IDs. Set `cancel` to keep the old state.

- Fire about to be placed: `block_ignite(dimension, player, pos, cause, cancel)` is heard for fire spread, lava, lightning and dispenser flint-and-steel. Set `cancel` to leave the position unchanged. Direct player flint-and-steel/fire-charge placement is not covered.

- `block_lock_check(player, name, pos, locked)` runs when a guest checks the container at `pos`; `locked` starts with vanilla's result and may be changed. The guest's state is not swapped in.

- A sculk sensor, calibrated sensor or shrieker received vibration event `event` at `pos`; `block` is its identifier. Set `cancel` to suppress the block's response.

- A dispenser sheared entity `entity` of kind `kind` at the block in front of the dispenser at `pos`, after the shearing effects.

- A brewing stand finished brewing: `brewing_complete(pos)` is heard after the bottles at `pos` received their brewed contents. Server-side.

- A brewing stand consumed fuel: `brewing_fuel(pos, fuel)` is heard after the stand at `pos` consumed the item `fuel` and gained brewing fuel. Server-side.

- A brewing stand starts brewing after it consumes fuel and sets its timer.

- An item was placed on a campfire and began cooking.

- A cauldron's fill level is about to change: `native_cauldron_level_changed(dimension, player, pos, from_level, to_level, reason, cancel)` is asked for rain, snow, dripstone and extinguishing.

- A server entity is about to be teleported by `/tp` or `/teleport`: `teleport_command(dimension, entity, from, to, cancel)` (NeoForge's `EntityTeleportEvent.TeleportCommand`) names the level it arrives in, its network id, its feet now and where the command sends it. A mod may move `to` (a value that is not a number is ignored); `cancel` leaves the entity where it is. It fires once per teleported entity, before `entity_teleport` and `player_teleported`, which hear the move after.

- A server player completed an advancement after progress was recorded; `advancement` is its identifier, such as `minecraft:story/mine_stone`.

- A server player's main-hand punch swing and attack-strength reset have happened: `player_attack_cooldown_reset(player, name)`.

- A server player about to enter a bed after its sleep checks pass: `player_bed_enter(player, name, pos, cancel)` hears the bed head position. Set `cancel` to keep the player out. The player's state is swapped in.

- A server player is waking or standing up from the bed at `pos`; `player_bed_leave` is heard before their sleeping state is cleared, so a listener still reads them as sleeping.

- A server entity about to travel to another level, a player or not: `entity_travel_to_dimension(entity, dimension, cause, cancel)` (NeoForge's `EntityTravelToDimensionEvent`) names the target level; `cause` is `nether_portal`, `end_portal`, `end_gateway` or `teleport`. Set `cancel` to keep the entity where it is. The player's state is not swapped in.

- A recipe about to become known to a server player: `player_recipe_discovered(player, name, recipe, cancel)` is heard for advancement rewards, knowledge books and `/recipe give`. Set `cancel` to keep it locked; the client is sent the matching removal. The player's state is not swapped in.

- A server player launches with a riptide trident: `player_riptide(player, name)` fires after the velocity and spin are applied. The player's state is swapped in.

- A server player swapped their main hand with an equipment slot: `player_swap_with_equipment_slot(player, name, slot)` fires after both hands changed; `slot` is currently `offhand`.

- A player is about to travel through an End gateway (`player_teleport_end_gateway(player, name, gateway, cancel)`). Set `cancel` to leave them at the entrance without starting the gateway cooldown.

- A server player used a golden dandelion on an ageable mob: `player_toggle_entity_age_lock(player, name, entity_id, locked)` fires after the lock and item use changed.

- A server player completed a villager or wandering trader trade, after the merchant menu applied the trade: `player_trade(player, name, entity_id)` gives the merchant's network id.

- A server player's action removed an entity's leash: `player_unleash_entity(player, name, entity_id)` fires after the leash state is cleared.

- The server synced changed motion to a player: `player_velocity(player, name, velocity)` fires with velocity in blocks per tick.

- `portal_create(dimension, pos)` is told after a Nether portal for dimension travel or the End arrival platform has been built, with its dimension and lower corner or platform origin.

- A thrown splash or lingering potion finished applying its hit effects; the hook reports the potion item and impact position. Experience bottles are excluded.

- A crafting-grid result was prepared: `prepare_item_craft(player, name, pos, result)` is called for the inventory grid (None) or a table at `pos`; change the result before it is sent to the menu. Guest state is not swapped in.

- Enchanting offers were calculated: `prepare_item_enchant(player, name, pos, costs)` is called for a server player at `pos`; change the three costs before they are sent to the menu. Guest state is not swapped in.

- A smithing result was prepared: `prepare_smithing(player, name, pos, result)` is called for a server player at `pos`; change the result before it is sent to the menu. Guest state is not swapped in.

- A projectile was added to the server level: `projectile_launch(player, name, entity, kind)` reports the entity id and type, plus the player launcher when there is one.

- A raid wave has spawned at its position, with its raid id, wave number and raider count (riders' mounts not counted).

- A raid is triggered or reaches `victory`, `loss` or `stopped`: `raid_state_change(raid, pos, state)` reports its owning `RaidRef`, center and new state. The handle retains its level even when that level is parked; an already removed raid cannot be read.

- `sculk_bloom(dimension, pos)` is called after a sculk catalyst at `pos` takes experience and enters the blooming state.

- `sponge_absorb(dimension, pos)` is called after a sponge at `pos` has absorbed water and become wet.

- A guest's server command completion request was evaluated: `tab_complete(player, name, command, range, suggestions)` lets a mod add or filter the suggestions; `range` is the replaced byte range. The guest's state is not swapped in.

- `target_hit(dimension, pos, strength)` is called after a projectile hits the target block at `pos` and it takes the reported redstone output strength.

- The server's `/weather` command is about to change thunder: `thunder_change(dimension, thundering, cancel)`. Set `cancel` and the previous thunder state and timer remain.

- The overworld clock is about to jump after sleep or a `/time` command: `time_skip(dimension, from, to, cause, cancel)`. Set `cancel` to keep the old time.

- A player selected a trade: `trade_select(player, name, villager, index)` is heard after the trading menu updates; `villager` is the entity id when known. The player's state is not swapped in.

- `vault_change_state(dimension, pos, state)` is called after a vault at `pos` changes to `state` (`inactive`, `active`, `unlocking`, or `ejecting`).

- The server's `/weather` command is about to change its rain and thunder parameters: `weather_change(dimension, raining, thundering, cancel)`. Set `cancel` and the prior weather and timers remain.

- The dedicated server's whitelist changed state: `whitelist_state_update(enabled)` reports its final on/off state, after `/whitelist on` or `/whitelist off` from a player or console.

- The server completed a world save cycle: `world_saved(wait)` reports whether chunk writes were flushed before returning.

- The time players wake at after sleeping, as NeoForge's `SleepFinishedTimeEvent`: `sleep_finished_time(dimension, current, new_time)` runs on the server once enough players have slept and the `advance_time` rule is on, before the clock moves. `new_time` comes in as the next morning and a mod may change it; a time before `current` is refused. `time_skip` then hears the jump to the chosen time.

- A shift-click in a mod container's menu routed by the mod, `AbstractContainerMenu.quickMoveStack`: `menu_quick_move(pos, entity, container_slots, slot, stack, handled)` runs on the server before the game's own routing, for a mod container on a vanilla menu type or its own menu type. The mod takes what it moves out of `stack` and sets `handled`; the slot keeps the rest and the client gets the menu again.

- A server player's trade with a villager or a wandering trader, as NeoForge's `TradeWithVillagerEvent`: `trade_with_villager(merchant, kind, offer)` is heard once per trade made, after its statistic and `villager_trade` trigger, with the trader's entity id and type and the `MerchantOffer` as it is after the trade. Listen only; the player's state is swapped in.

- A server player's or fox's `teleport_randomly` consume effect (chorus fruit) is about to try a spot: version 2 of `item_consumption_teleport(consumer, consumed, from, target, cancel)`, once per attempt (up to 16). `consumer` is the living actor's handle and `consumed` is the public API stack captured before the use, with its count, damage and component patch, rather than the current contents of the hand. The living handle replaces version 1's player-only UUID/name fields; players retain their acting-player context. A mod may move `target`; the game still looks down from it for ground to land on. `cancel` ends the effect with no teleport and no more attempts, not consumption. A fox's callback runs with the full server host before its living AI/movement and before the next mob ticks; listener changes to its mouth item, position or eligibility invalidate the captured decision rather than being overwritten.

- A server player's or mob's ender pearl landed: version 3 of `native_ender_pearl_teleport(owner, pearl, from, target, damage, cancel, hit_entity, hit_block, hit_face, hit_at)` runs before teleporting the live `EntityRef` owner. A mod may move `target`; cancellation spends the pearl without a teleport, sound, player damage or endermite roll. A player retains acting-player context and mutable fall damage (5). A mob preserves rotation, resets fall distance, takes no player fall damage and makes no endermite draw. A listener's move or an owner that is no longer eligible invalidates the pending move; it is refused rather than overwriting that write. `owner` replaces version 1's player-only UUID/name fields; use its handle and the host services. Version 3 adds what the pearl hit (`hit_entity`, `hit_block`, `hit_face`, `hit_at`). Named injections must request `hook_version = 3`; no compatibility fields or older alias are retained.

- Drawing an item stack on a screen: `native_item_stack(batch, stack, at, size)` draws its model, glint, damage bar, cooldown and mod decorations, but not its count. It draws nothing and returns false for an unknown item or an empty stack (air, or a count of 0).

- Hiding a player (a vanish): `player.hide(host, level)` hides that player, from the next tick, from the players below permission `level` (None shows them again): they leave those players' Tab list and world (their clients stop tracking them, as they do a spectator) and those players don't read them joining or leaving. Players of `level` or more still see them; a player made an operator sees them again. Retain a `PlayerRef` obtained while the player is available: unlike live-player writes, hide can still change that UUID's visibility after disconnect, within the handle's world epoch. It cannot target an arbitrary offline UUID, and a handle from a closed or reopened world refuses the write. The visibility setting is kept by UUID across reconnects until changed or the server stops. It requires `&mut dyn ServerHost` and an available server player list.

- A player's item breaking: `player_destroy_item(player, name, item, slot)` is heard for a server player whose tool, shield, rod or armour piece ran out of durability (`LivingEntity.onEquippedItemBroken`, Bukkit's `PlayerItemBreakEvent`), with the item that broke and the slot it was in (`mainhand`, `offhand`, `head`, `chest`, `legs`, `feet`, `body`, `saddle`); armour has a slot rather than a hand. `ItemPart::damage_item` is the wear, this is only the break. Listen only. The player's state is swapped in. Not heard for a creative player or for the host of a LAN world.

- A player's damaging melee hit on a living target: `critical_hit(target_kind, vanilla_critical, critical, damage_multiplier)` may force or deny the critical hit and change its multiplier (1.5 for a vanilla crit, else 1.0); the sweep, sound and particles follow the decided result. Not fired for a dragon part or a hit that does no damage.

- Attachment reads that never insert the default: `AttachmentType::has` says whether a holder carries a value, saved or set,
  even before it decodes (NeoForge's `hasData`), and `AttachmentType::get_existing` returns `None` instead of the default
  (NeoForge's `getExistingData`). Neither adds anything to the holder's saved data.

- A player releases a bow: `arrow_loose(stack, has_ammo, charge, canceled)` may change held-tick `charge` or cancel the shot; negative charge also prevents it. Unlike `living_entity_use_item_stop`, it does not skip the whole item release; `entity_shoot_bow` reports the spawned arrow afterward with read-only force. Fires on the Game running the bow release, including LAN guests; a remote client's own release path, crossbows, and ArrowNockEvent are not covered.

- An item frame or painting about to break: `hanging_break(player, kind, pos, cancel)` is heard before a server player's hit, a blast or the loss of its wall breaks an item frame, a glow item frame or a painting, with the hitting player (None for a blast or a lost wall). A mod sets `cancel` and it stays. The hitting player's state is swapped in. A hit that only takes a frame's item out, the game's own player and `/kill` are not asked.

- A criterion of a server player's advancement was granted or revoked after its progress changed and before any completion rewards, except the `minecraft:tick` criteria granted on a network player's first tick or a reload, which are heard after that tick's rewards and packets; `advancement` is its identifier, such as `minecraft:story/mine_stone`, `criterion` the criterion name and `progress_type` is `ProgressType::Grant` or `ProgressType::Revoke`. A grant or revoke that changes nothing is not heard.

- A statistic about to be awarded to a server player: `player_stat_award(player, name, stat_type, stat, value, cancel)`. The canonical namespaced `stat_type` and `stat` strings and the `i32` amount `value` are writable. Unknown types or entries, noncanonical ids and negative amounts keep the entire original award, with a warning once. Registered custom stats are valid redirect targets. Set `cancel` to award nothing: the count and its scoreboard criteria stay as they were. Transaction-deferred awards fire only after the outermost successful commit.

- A player's data copied to their replacement: `player_clone(player, name, was_death, original)` fires after death (`was_death` true) and the credits-showing End return (`was_death` false), after vanilla state and attachments are copied and before placement (`ServerPlayer.restoreFrom`, NeoForge's `PlayerEvent.Clone`). `player` is the replacement's UUID; `original: OriginalPlayerRef` reads all pre-copy attachments, health, experience, effects, inventory after death drops (or intact with keep-inventory and on End return), position, dimension and level only during the hook, on native and wasm. Set/remove on the original refuse; lazy reads/defaults work. No subscriber means no snapshot. Nothing swaps a player's state in.

- A player loaded from the world's save: `player_load_from_file(player, name, directory)` is heard once for each join (the owner of an integrated server too), after the player's `.dat` is read and applied and before they are placed in a level (NeoForge's `PlayerEvent.LoadFromFile`, `PlayerList.loadPlayerData`). `directory` is the world's player directory (`players/data`); a mod reads its own file there, named `<uuid>.<suffix>`. It cannot change or stop anything; no player's state is swapped in.

- A player saved to the world's store: `player_save_to_file(player, name, directory)` is heard once for each save of a placed player (when they leave or the world closes, when the dedicated server saves everyone, and for an integrated server's owner when the world saves them; LAN guests are not heard on integrated autosaves) after their data is written (NeoForge's `PlayerEvent.SaveToFile`, `PlayerList.save`). `directory` is the world's player directory (`players/data`); write your own file there, named `<uuid>.<suffix>`, never the player's `.dat`. The player may be leaving, so no player's state is swapped in. It cannot change or stop anything.

- `item_expire(entity, stack, extra_life)`, a dropped item reaching its lifetime on the server (NeoForge's `ItemExpireEvent`, vanilla `ItemEntity.tick`): every mod may set or add to `extra_life`, in ticks from zero; a positive total keeps the item that much longer, zero or less lets it expire. Extensions are capped at 32766 ticks.

- The title's own screens to the screen hooks. `ScreenView.id` has one id per title state (`title`, `world_select`, `world_create`, `world_create_flat`, `world_create_buffet`, `world_preset_editor`, `world_edit`, `world_backup`, `world_backup_confirm`, `world_optimize_confirm`, `world_optimize`, `low_disk_space`, `world_delete`, `world_recover`, `world_recovered`, `error`, `multiplayer`, `add_server`, `edit_server`, `direct_connect`, `server_delete`, `friends_join`, `disconnected`, `multiplayer_warning`, `onboarding`, `ban_notice`), with no `menu`, no `title` and no `slots`, and the whole window as `rect`. `screen_render_post` fires after the title draws its screen (before its toasts), and the `_pre` input hooks — mouse buttons, drag, wheel, key press and release, character typed — fire on it and can cancel it as on any screen, so a mod draws its own button or browser over Create New World and takes the clicks. A dialog, a prompt or a server's pack prompt over the title keeps them away, and typing still goes to the title's own boxes (with no box focused the key's text stays on the key, as on Options, so `screen_char_typed_pre` fires before the key acts there). `native_instance_dir()` is the instance folder, where `options.txt`, `saves/`, `resourcepacks/`, `shaderpacks/` and `horizon-mods/` are; a world's `datapacks/` is in that world's folder.
- A player took an anvil's result: `anvil_craft_post(player, name, pos, craft)` (NeoForge's `AnvilCraftEvent.Post`) is heard after the levels, the inputs and the anvil wear are done, so a broken anvil is already air. `craft` holds the inputs and the result as they were before. Not heard when `anvil_craft_pre` cancelled.

- A player took an anvil's result: `anvil_craft_pre(player, name, pos, craft, cancel)` (NeoForge's `AnvilCraftEvent.Pre`) runs before the levels are charged, the inputs used up and the anvil worn. `craft` holds the left and right inputs and the result as they were before. Set `cancel` to refuse the take and skip the matching `anvil_craft_post`: the result stays in its slot and the inputs, levels, inventory and cursor are as before the click.

- A server player stopped digging `pos` before the block broke: `block_damage_abort(player, name, pos)` is heard after the server clears the dig and sends the block state back to the client. The player's state is not swapped in.

- A mob is about to drop `count` of `item` at `pos`: `entity_drop_item(entity, item, count, pos)`.

- A mob's leash was removed, before any lead drop is handled: `entity_unleash(entity, kind)`.

- A server explosion is about to begin at `center` with `radius` (`explosion_prime`); the hook is listen-only and the explosion proceeds as usual.

- A hopper selects a container while searching for items: `hopper_inventory_search(hopper, container, entity)` identifies the hopper and the selected block container or container entity.

- A hopper is about to move one item between containers: `inventory_move_item(source, destination, item, cancel)` runs before the source slot is changed, a composter's bone meal included; a chest boat or minecart is reported at the block it is in. Set `cancel` to keep the item in its source slot.

- A dropped item entity reached its 6000-tick lifetime and is about to be removed: `item_despawn(entity, item, count, pos)`.

- A boat or minecart joined the level at `pos`, after a player or dispenser placed it: `vehicle_create(kind, pos)` is listen-only.

- A player is about to damage a boat or minecart: `vehicle_damage(kind, damage, cancel)` may change the damage or cancel it before the vehicle's damage and wobble change; the attack still completes.

- A boat or minecart is about to be destroyed at `pos`: `vehicle_destroy(kind, pos)` is heard just before it is removed; TNT minecarts that prime instead are not heard.

- A guest's arm swing: `player_arm_swing(player, name, hand)` is called after the server handles the guest's `Punch` packet and resets attack strength. The current packet swings `mainhand`; the guest's state is swapped in.

- A server player selected the item at `index` in a bundle in menu `slot`: `player_bundle_item_select(player, name, slot, index)`.

- A server player's client finished loading the level around them after joining, respawning or changing dimension: `player_client_loaded_world(player, name)`.

- A guest's player input flags: `player_input(player, name, flags)` is called after a loaded guest's `PlayerInput` packet is applied to the hub. `flags` is the packet's bit field; the guest's state is swapped in.

- A guest jumped: `player_jump(player, name)` is called after accepted movement made the server player jump from the ground, once the guest's movement simulation finished. The guest's state is swapped in.

- A guest was kicked from the server: `player_kicked(player, name, reason)` is called after the hub records the rendered reason and sends the disconnect. The guest's state is swapped in.

- A LAN guest launched a snowball, egg, ender pearl, potion or trident: `player_launch_projectile(player, name, item)` runs after the projectile is created.

- A server player's experience level changed: `player_level_change(player, name, from, to)` is called after experience points or levels change their level, including orb points. The player's state is swapped in when they are a guest.

- A server player released a drawn bow, by the use-item key or a mod's `release_using_item`, with `player_ready_arrow(player, name, arrow)`: the name of the selected projectile item.

- A server player's recipe book open or filter setting changed: `player_recipe_book_settings_change(player, name, book, open, filtering)`, where `book` is its typed `RecipeBookIdentity`.

- A server player released the use-item key, or a mod's `release_using_item` did, before the item finished being used: `player_stop_using_item(player, name)`.

- A guest's player input changed sneaking: `player_toggle_sneak(player, name, sneaking)` is called after the hub applies the new state, only when it changes. The guest's state is swapped in.

- A hopper begins a transfer attempt: `prepare_hopper_transfer(pos)` runs after its cooldown and enabled checks, before it pushes or pulls items.

- A vault is about to eject a loot item: `vault_loot(pos, item)` supplies the vault position and item identifier before it spawns.

- A timed world border size change finished: `world_border_bounds_change_finish()` fires after the border reaches its final size.

- `Game::native_mod_image(width, height, rgba)`: a mod's own RGBA image, uploaded into the HUD atlas slot `horizon/modimage` (1024 by 1024) and drawn with `native_sprite`, whose source rectangle crops and stretches it, so a map or a schematic view needs no texture of its own. The slot is reserved only while a native mod is loaded, so a game without mods pays none of its 4 MiB. False for an image that is not `width * height` pixels of four bytes, is larger than the slot, or when there is no slot. Each upload is a texture patch of the image, so send one when the image changed, not every frame.
- A living entity drowning (`living_drown`), with changeable drowning, damage and bubble count, and cancellation.
- `Game::native_translate(key)`: the selected language's text for a translation key, or `None` when no language layer defines it (`I18n.exists`), so a mod can fall back its own way (a recipe viewer names an item tag by `tag.item.<namespace>.<path>` and falls back to the id). NeoForge: `I18n.exists` and `I18n.get`. Client-side.
- `Game::native_enchantments()`, `Game::native_enchantment_supports(id, item)` and `Game::native_enchantment_min_cost(id, level)`: every registered enchantment as an `EnchantmentInfo { id, max_level, curse }` record in registry order, whether one can go on an item (`Enchantment.isSupportedItem`), and the power a level needs (`Enchantment.getMinCost`), or `None` for an unknown enchantment. What a recipe viewer lists for grindstone and anvil enchanting. NeoForge: the `enchantment` registry (`RegistryAccess.lookupOrThrow(Registries.ENCHANTMENT)`), `Enchantment.getMaxLevel`, `Enchantment.isSupportedItem`, `Enchantment.getMinCost`, the `minecraft:curse` tag. Client-side.
- `Game::native_fluid(batch, fluid, [x, y], size)` and `Game::native_fluid_name(fluid)`: a fluid (`minecraft:water`, `mymod:oil`) as a square of `size` GUI pixels, the GUI sprite its look names (`data/<mod>/horizon/fluid/<name>.json`) tinted with its colour, else a flat square of the colour (vanilla water and lava have theirs), and its name as the lang gives it. What a recipe viewer draws for a fluid stack; the slot, the amount and the tooltip are the mod's. NeoForge: `IClientFluidTypeExtensions.getStillTexture` and `getTintColor`. Client-side.

- A living entity's fall (`living_fall`), with changeable distance and multiplier and cancellation.

- A living entity healing (`living_heal`), with a changeable amount and cancellation.

- A living entity jumping (`living_jump`)."##]
    #[notes = r#"## Hook and helper capabilities

- `ClientHost::panel_items` shows an item panel beside container screens; `panel_event` supplies the player's
  clicks, searches and keys over its items. `Host::recipes_of_type` returns `Recipe` values with parsed ingredients,
  results and rules for supported vanilla types, and the original JSON for mod-defined types. `Recipe` does not
  define display pages, per-result chances or fluid input/output slots: a viewer interprets its own machine-recipe
  JSON and draws those details itself. `known_recipes`, `place_recipe` and `transfer_recipe` provide recipe-book
  integration, `transfer_recipe_check` its dry run on the server; they do not create a machine-recipe display record.
  `native_sprite` takes an optional `tint` (`0xAARRGGBB`) that multiplies every texel, as a fluid's colour does.
  `DrawContext::text(text, at, argb, shadow)` takes its colour as vanilla's `GuiGraphics` does, `0xAARRGGBB`
  (`0xFFFFFFFF` is opaque white), and draws nothing for a fully transparent one, as vanilla's does.
  `DrawContext::text_width(text)` measures what `native_text` draws, in GUI pixels, to lay text out before drawing
  it (`Font.width`). A sprite's own size is `gui_sprite(&id)`'s `size`, read once in `texture_atlas_stitched`.
  Diverges from upstream: there `native_text` takes an opaque `0xRRGGBB`.
  Slot clicks keep their `SlotClicked` numbering: inputs, then results.

- `GameLevel::native_send_particles` on authoritative servers. It sends supported
  vanilla particles to nearby players. Block particles require a valid block state; item particles
  require a validated stack. Trail and vibration remain unsupported. Count zero sends one directional
  particle. The return value says whether the call was accepted, not whether any player received it.

- Authoritative world lifecycle events through `world_lifecycle`: open failed, final close and
  close failed (contract version 2). **Migration (`WorldPhase::WorldOpenReady` → `server_started`):** a mod that matched
  `WorldOpenReady` in `world_lifecycle` implements `server_started` instead, fired at the same moment (after the worlds
  open, before the tick loop; one call per successful open, with the same `dedicated` flag as `server_about_to_start`);
  delete the match arm. Nothing else about the phases changed. Diverges from upstream: upstream still has the phase.

- Authoritative server tick events through `server_tick`: start (before any level ticks, like NeoForge's `ServerTickEvent.Pre`) and end of each non-paused
  server tick, with `world_running`. A frozen world reports false except during a requested step.

- Server commands and players: `register_commands` (the commands a mod adds to every player's
  command tree) and `run_mod_command` (a player's command on the server), with helpers to answer
  ([Server commands and players](#server-commands-and-players)).

- A player's items for server mods: counting, taking and giving go through the player's
  [`ENTITY_ITEMS`](../concepts/capabilities/entity-items.md) handler.

- Server menus: a vanilla chest menu a server mod opens and fills, whose clicks and closing reach the mod
  (`menu_clicked`, `menu_closed`), and trades on them between the players'
  [`ENTITY_ITEMS`](../concepts/capabilities/entity-items.md) handlers in one transaction ([Server menus](#server-menus)).

- Item tooltips: an `ItemPart`'s `tooltip` adds its item's own lines where `Item.appendHoverText` does, after
  the name and before the components' lines, never for a tooltip the stack hides.
  `Hooks::item_tooltip` (NeoForge's `ItemTooltipEvent`) then gets every item's whole tooltip once it is
  complete, with the local player, the stack's `TooltipDisplay` and its `TooltipFlag` (`advanced`, `creative`),
  and may add, change or remove any line. Horizon's creative search reads vanilla's exported tooltip text, so it
  does not fire with no player while search trees are built.

- Data component tooltip lines: `Registrar::register_tooltip_appender(component, placement, appender)` (NeoForge's
  `RegisterTooltipAppendersEvent`) gives one component's `TooltipAppender` a `TooltipPlacement`: `BeforeAll`, `AfterAll`,
  or `Before(id)` and `After(id)` for a component detail Horizon lists (`minecraft:lore`, `minecraft:enchantments`...), where
  the lines go among the other components' lines. The game asks only that appender, only for a stack that carries the
  component (live, transient ones included) and whose `tooltip_display` shows it, and only while its mod is enabled. It gets
  the stack and a `TooltipAppendContext` (the local player, `advanced`, `creative`, and `nested` for a crossbow's projectile),
  and adds its lines after the item's own lines and before the durability and advanced lines. The creative search doesn't read
  these lines, as it doesn't `item_tooltip`. A mod that reacts to every item keeps `item_tooltip`.
  `Before`/`After` accept only the 23 vanilla anchors listed in `tooltip_appender.rs`, not other registered
  components. The `registerAppender(TooltipLocation, ...)` overload is not represented. Several appenders may register
  for one component; all run in registration order at an equal placement. The player is always the local player,
  including for nested crossbow projectiles where vanilla passes no player; use `nested` to distinguish those calls.

- An item's own server behaviour: `ItemPart::use_on(host, event)` hears a right click with its item on a
  block once the block let it through (`ItemStack.useOn`), and `ItemPart::use_item(host, event)` hears the
  item's own use, in the air or after `use_on` let it through (`Item.use`). Each hears a click once.
  Claiming either skips the template and swings the hand. These scoped methods have no global `Hooks` equivalent.

- A block's own item-use behaviour, on the server for every player: attach a `BlockPart` and implement
  `use_item_on(host, event) -> Option<InteractionResult>`. `event.state` keys the per-state table;
  `event.click` carries the level, position, hit, hand, stack and player. `Some` replaces the template's
  `Block.useItemOn`: `Success`/`SuccessServer` consume and swing, `Consume` consumes without swinging,
  `Pass`/`Fail` let the item try its `useOn`, and `TryWithEmptyHand` tries the block's `useWithoutItem`
  on the main hand only. `None` leaves the template in charge. This is the block's behaviour, not
  NeoForge's separate `UseItemOnBlockEvent` broadcast interceptor. The earlier `right_click_block`
  event still decides whether the block is used at all. Dispatch visits only the clicked state's parts.

- Global interaction interception on both sides: `Hooks::use_item_on_block(host, event)` is NeoForge's
  `UseItemOnBlockEvent`. `event.phase` is `UsePhase::Block` just before the block's item method/Part,
  or `ItemAfterBlock` just before the item's `use_on` method/Part. It fires only after that phase's
  sneak, `use_block`/`use_item`, cooldown and other eligibility gates select it. `event.click`
  (`BlockClick`) supplies the dimension, hit, hand, stack and player. Return `Flow::Cancel` to
  skip that phase's Part and template, using `*event.cancellation_result` as the phase's result
  (default `TryWithEmptyHand`); a main-hand block-phase TRY can still run the empty method.
  `UsePhase::ItemBeforeBlock` fires first, before the item's `on_item_use_first` Part and before
  the block is asked anything (ahead of the sneak gate, unless `right_click_block` denied the item);
  canceling skips that item's Part, but `Pass` continues to the block. Any non-`Pass` answer ends the block interaction. On the client only this broadcast event fires:
  a Part's claim comes from the server, which corrects the predicted click as it does for the block
  Part.
- `ItemPart::on_item_use_first(host, event)` is `IItemExtension.onItemUseFirst`, server side, for the
  held item (`event.click` is the same `BlockClick`). Return `Some(result)` to end the click:
  neither the block nor the item's `use_on` runs, and `Success` swings the hand. `None` or `Pass`
  goes on to the block. It has no global method: NeoForge's bus event for this moment is
  `use_item_on_block`'s `ItemBeforeBlock` phase.

- `Hooks::right_click_item(host, event)` is NeoForge's `PlayerInteractEvent.RightClickItem`, before
  `Item.use` and the item's `use_item` Part on both sides, after the same hand's target interaction falls through.
  `event.click` (`ItemClick`) contains the dimension, player's feet block position, player,
  hand and stack. `Flow::Cancel` skips the Part/template and returns `*event.cancellation_result`
  (default `Pass`). `Success`, `SuccessServer` and `Consume` end the client's hand loop. `Success`
  predicts a swing, `SuccessServer` swings on the server, and `Consume` has no swing. A block
  success, block FAIL, or entity success prevents item fallback; the server fires this on the separate UseItem packet
  rather than on UseItemOn.

- A block's empty-hand behaviour: `BlockPart::use_without_item(host, event)` replaces
  `Block.useWithoutItem` on the server, on the main hand only, after `useItemOn` returns
  `TryWithEmptyHand`. The event keeps the original state's key even if the item phase
  changed the block. `Some` replaces the template; `None` runs it, including jukebox ejection,
  pot wobble and bookshelf removal. Consuming results trigger DEFAULT_BLOCK_USE.
  `Pass`, `Fail` and `TryWithEmptyHand` continue to the item; the empty method is never
  retried. Dispatch visits only the clicked state's parts.

- Breaking and placing a block, on the server for every player: `break_block` hears a player break a
  block once the game allowed it (`ServerPlayerGameMode.destroyBlock`) and may cancel it, which keeps the block and its
  drops. Set `exp_to_drop` to `Some(amount)` to replace the vanilla XP sample later, after item drops are prepared;
  `None` retains vanilla sampling. The subsequent `block_drops` event can edit the resulting experience or cancel
  the drops, and disabled block drops suppress both items and XP. `entity_place` (`EntityPlaceEvent`, `EntityMultiPlaceEvent`) hears a block placed from an item
  (`BlockItem.place`), an enderman putting its block down or a snow golem's trail, before it is written, and may cancel it:
  nothing is placed and the stack is kept. For a player, `placed_against` is the state next to the primary placed
  block opposite the clicked face, even when the clicked block is replaceable; for mobs it is the state below.
  A bed, door or tall plant arrives as one `Placement::Multi`. Silverfish
  infesting, turtle eggs and falling blocks are not placements yet.

- Block entities for a mod's blocks (`block_entity`, `block_entity_ticks`,
  `block_entity_tick`): made when the block is placed, ticked on the server and saved with the chunk.
  `entity.id()` reads its type identity, fixed at construction; mutable events give a `ModBlockEntityView` whose
  payload contains `nbt`, `items` and `data`. A mod cannot replace the view or access its private entity handle.

- Item slots for those block entities (`r.block_container(&block, container)`): hoppers, comparators and breaking the
  block use them as they use vanilla's containers, and `block_entity_tick` also gets the slots.

- Menus for mod containers: the container names one of vanilla's slot-grid or furnace menus, which opens when the block is used,
  and `block_entity_tick` takes the whole block entity, with the data slots the menu shows.

- A machine reaches neighbouring storage through the block's Parts and capabilities, not a raw mutable
  block-entity callback. `block_entity.data_slots(host)` reads a mod entity's menu data on the server or
  the client's own copy; `set_data_slot(host, slot, value)` writes a declared slot on the server under
  the current transaction, rolls back on abort, and uses the normal menu broadcast to viewers.
  `level.set_block` uses the level's normal update path.

- Screens a mod draws for its blocks' menus: `screen` lays one out (its height, where each container slot is,
  where the inventory starts; a slot it leaves out is not in the menu, so shift-clicks skip it) and `screen_draw` draws it with the mod's
  own GUI textures (`assets/<namespace>/textures/gui`, drawn with `native_sprite`).

- Buttons, tooltips and item icons on mod screens: `screen_click` and `screen_tooltip` (the client), `menu_button`
  (a button press on the server, on the mod block entity) and the helpers `native_item`, `native_screen_title`, `LevelRef::block`,
  `LevelRef::block_property` and `native_cursor`. A mod inserts items through the block's item capability,
  `level.capability(host, &ITEMS, pos, side)`.
- `menu.click_button(host, button)`, on a client `MenuRef`, presses button `button` of the open menu as a click on one of its buttons does
  (`MultiPlayerGameMode.handleInventoryButtonClick`, `ServerboundContainerButtonClickPacket`); the server's menu decides what it does
  (`clickMenuButton`, and `menu_button` for a mod's menu). It is for a client mod's own input on a menu's screen where `screen_click`
  doesn't come, such as a key or the wheel (`screen_key_pressed_pre`, `screen_mouse_scrolled_pre`). It returns `false` for a stale
  handle and for the inventory menu, which no server opened.

- What a server mod needs to guard land and move players. `right_click_block` hears a player's right
  click on a block before the block's own use (a chest, a door, a lever) and the item's, and may cancel it
  with NeoForge's answer: `Fail` stops the click, and the player sees the block as it
  is. `host.players().acting_player()` returns the acting player handle;
  `host.commands().run_command` runs a command as the server's console (level 4, no output), so `execute in <dimension> run tp
  <player> <x> <y> <z>` moves a player across levels; `PlayerRef::action_bar` tells a player why, even inside their own
  hook; and the handles `host.players().server_players()` lists expose health through `player.entity().living(host)`.

- What a server mod needs to keep the world itself out of guarded land. `block_spread` hears a
  fluid flow or fire spread into a block, `native_piston_pre` a piston's push or pull, `explosion_detonate` the
  blocks an explosion is about to break (a mod takes out those it spares), `fill_bucket` a bucket filled or
  emptied, and `attack_entity` a player's blow on an entity (an item frame, an armor stand, an animal, a
  player). Each may cancel, and nothing happens.

- `level_tick_pre` and `level_tick_post`, both-sided observations around each
  level tick pass. Each receives the dimension ID; neither can cancel the tick. Paused and held passes fire
  neither hook, and an error skips the post hook.

- `native_set_block`, a server-side `Game` helper that replaces a state in the current dimension through
  `Level.setBlock`. It accepts vanilla's neighbour and shape flags and returns whether a block changed; a block with a
  block entity gets one. `UPDATE_CLIENTS` sends the update; `UPDATE_INVISIBLE` suppresses notification only on the client, as in `Level.setBlock`. Hooks holding only `GameLevel` cannot call it yet.

- `GameLevel::play_sound` for registered vanilla sound events on an authoritative server.
  It queues the sound for nearby players in the level's dimension, including during a guest's turn.
  Pass a `SOUND_SOURCES` index, position, volume and pitch. The return value says whether the call
  was queued, not whether a player heard it. The server discards unknown sound events when it dispatches
  the queue.

- `Host::config_files()`: the calling mod's own files in the game's shared `config/` folder beside `options.txt` (beside
  `server.properties` on a dedicated server): its folder `config/<mod id>/` and the files beside it named
  `<mod id>.<ext>` or `<mod id>-<rest>`. `ConfigFiles` reads, writes, lists and stats them through `&dyn Host` on
  either side, at most 4 MiB a file; a write replaces the file at once. The service is bound to the mod whose hook or
  part is running (a mod never names its id), so another mod's path, a symbolic link on the way or a call outside any
  mod's hook is refused with a typed `ConfigFileError`. A path is a `ConfigPath`, checked once when it is made. A
  world's `serverconfig/` copy is read only through `config_loading` ([native mods](../how-to/native-mods.md)).

- The player-health HUD rows through `health_hud`: every frame the HUD draws them, the
  hook hears the layout's inputs (`HealthInputs`) and the screen's GUI size, and a mod that answers with
  draws replaces all the rows — armour, hearts, food, air and the heights above the hotbar — for that
  frame. Nothing answered draws Horizon's own.

- Which hearts the player's health bar draws through `player_heart_type` (NeoForge's `PlayerHeartTypeEvent`):
  each frame the HUD draws the hearts, `kind` comes in as vanilla's pick (poisoned, withered, frozen or normal) and a mod
  may set another. It runs before `health_hud`, whose `inputs.kind` carries the answer; only the heart sprites
  change.

- Where each boss bar is drawn through `customize_boss_event_progress` (NeoForge's
  `CustomizeGuiOverlayEvent.BossEventProgress`): once a frame per bar, in the order the server added them, `x` and
  `y` come in as the bar's top-left corner (91 left of the centre; 12, then 19 lower for each bar) and `increment` as
  the spacing to the next (19). The bar and its title are drawn where a mod moved them, and the next bar comes in
  `increment` below where this one came in. A cancelled bar is not drawn and its increment still applies. Bars stop
  once the next would start a third of the way down the screen. With no listener nothing is built per bar.

- Where the in-game chat is drawn through `customize_chat_overlay` (NeoForge's `CustomizeGuiOverlayEvent.Chat`):
  each frame the chat layer draws, `x` and `y` come in as the chat's bottom-left corner (0 and the GUI height minus 40)
  with the GUI size and whether the chat screen is open, and the chat is drawn shifted to where a mod moved them. Not
  asked while the chat is hidden (F1 with the chat closed). Only the drawing moves; the input box and clicks on
  messages stay in vanilla's place, as with NeoForge.

- Right-clicking an entity, on the server for every player: `entity_interact` hears a right click on
  an entity (its id and type, the typed `Hand::Main` or `Hand::Off`, and the stack in that hand) where `Player.interactOn` starts, once per hand. A mod that claims
  it swings the hand instead of the entity's and the item's own interaction.

- Left-clicking a block, on the server for every player: `left_click_block` hears the start of a dig
  (the block, the face hit) once the game allowed it, before the block is attacked (a note block plays) or broken in
  creative. A mod that cancels it keeps the block: on the server it isn't attacked, dug or broken, and the player's client
  gets it back. The clicking player's own client still predicts the crack until then.

- A player's tick: `player_tick_pre` and `player_tick_post` match NeoForge 26.3's
  non-cancellable `PlayerTickEvent.Pre`/`Post` on **both logical sides**, including
  ordinary single player's client window and server-thread players. Match the typed
  `HostSide`; the event's `player: PlayerRef` unambiguously names the ticked player
  (including other client-side players). On the server the helpers read that acting
  player. Pre precedes sleep/cooldown/body work; Post follows it, including item,
  arrow and XP pickups. Dead players still receive the pair without enabling dead
  actions. Players tick under `/tick freeze`, not while paused. With no listeners,
  the added per-player cost is only the indexed subscriber probe for each endpoint;
  listeners on the server pay an acting-guest enter/leave at each endpoint, reusing
  the already resolved guest index (no second connection lookup).

- Shape updates a mod can answer through `native_update_shape`: on an authoritative server, each time a
  block's state is worked out from a neighbour (`BlockBehaviour.updateShape`): neighbour shape updates after a
  `setBlock`, a block fitted to all its neighbours as a piston lands it or a chunk is post-processed, and the blocks at
  a feature's edge as it is placed in the live world, such as a tree grown from a sapling
  (`StructureTemplate.updateShapeAtEdge`). It gets the dimension, position, state, the neighbour's direction, position
  and state, before the block computes it. `state` may not be in the world yet (a piston landing it), so decide from
  `state`, not from the block at `pos`. Answer only for your own blocks and leave `new` empty otherwise: a state put
  there is the block's new state, applied as vanilla applies the result (air breaks the block, with its drops, on a
  neighbour update; post-processing and a feature's edge write air without drops), and the block's own `updateShape`
  doesn't run, nor the ticks it would schedule. The level is read-only, as vanilla's `LevelReader` is there; the hook
  schedules ticks with its `ticks` through the level's `native_schedule_block_tick(ticks, pos, block, delay)` and
  `native_schedule_fluid_tick(ticks, pos, fluid, delay)` (vanilla's `ScheduledTickAccess.scheduleTick`; false for an
  unknown name or a position that isn't loaded). It runs often, at least six times per `setBlock` that updates shapes
  (more for redstone wire's diagonals and knock-on updates): keep it short. A LAN guest shows vanilla's shape for a
  moment, until the server's update arrives. Chunk generation fires none.

- Random ticks a mod can handle through `random_tick`: on an authoritative server, each block
  `ServerLevel.tickChunk` random-ticks (`BlockState.randomTick`), with its dimension, position and state, before the
  block handles it. Only blocks that tick randomly fire it (a mod block as its vanilla template block does), once per
  draw that lands on one: it runs often, so keep it short. Bone meal's random ticks (`StemBlock.performBonemeal` calls
  `randomTick` itself) don't fire it. The hook may change the block with the level's
  `native_set_block_property(ticks, pos, key, value, flags)` and set `handled` to skip the block's own random tick, so a
  mod crop grows its own way. Without `handled`, the block then takes its own random tick as it is now (if it still
  ticks randomly), and lava's fluid random tick runs either way. It needs the level mutably, which only `random_tick` and `tick_block` give. It is `Game::native_set_block_property` with `Level.setBlock`'s flags (`native_hooks::flags`): a
  vanilla crop grows with `flags::UPDATE_CLIENTS` (neighbours' shapes update, so an observer fires, but no neighbour
  gets `neighborChanged` and comparators aren't told), a furnace sets its `lit` with `flags::UPDATE_ALL` (both). Horizon
  sends updates when `UPDATE_CLIENTS` (2) is set; `UPDATE_INVISIBLE` (4) suppresses notification only on the client, as in `Level.setBlock`. `UPDATE_IMMEDIATE` (8) has no effect yet. It writes at any loaded position, returns false off an authoritative server (the `Game` one too: a window that isn't a server), for a property or
  value the block doesn't have, a position that isn't loaded, or a property that already has the value (nothing is written:
  vanilla's `Level.setBlock` returns false for an unchanged state, as `native_set_block` does), and true when the block changed. Elsewhere, `Game::native_set_block_property_with(pos, key, value, flags)` does the same, as a brewing
  stand's tick sets its bottles with `flags::UPDATE_CLIENTS`.

- Scheduled block ticks a mod can handle through `tick_block`: on an authoritative server, each due
  scheduled tick of a block that is still there (`ServerLevel.tickBlock` → `BlockState.tick`), with its dimension,
  position and state, before the block handles it. The hook may change the block with the level's
  `native_set_block_property` and the flags the block's own tick would write with (an observer's tick
  uses `flags::UPDATE_CLIENTS`) and set `handled` to skip the block's own tick. Without `handled`, the block then takes
  its own tick as it is now, if it is still the tick's block.

- The commands a mod owns on the client, as NeoForge's `RegisterClientCommandsEvent`: `register_client_commands` is asked for a `Command` per usage (`x <mode:word>`, the same usage form as `register_commands`), so the chat box colours, completes and lists them, arguments included, like the game's own, and `command` runs them. A name the game already has keeps that command; a nonzero `level` has no meaning on the client and the command is left out with a log line. It replaces `commands`, which gave bare names: a mod that implemented it pushes `Command::new("name <args:text>")` instead. Asked at connect, never per frame.
- The keys a mod registers on Options > Controls, as NeoForge's `RegisterKeyMappingsEvent`: call
  `Registrar::register_key_mapping(KeyRegistration::new("zoom", "key.keyboard.z").label("key.mymod.zoom"))`
  from `Hooks::register`. Ownership comes from the registrar; invalid or duplicate local ids refuse startup.
  `.category(...)` takes a translation key, `.modifiers(...)` sets shift/control/alt, and `.context(...)` takes
  `KeyConflictContext::{Universal, InGame, Gui}`. Only client startup collects the retained declarations for Controls;
  dedicated and integrated servers do not. One editor persists keys and modifiers in `horizon-mods.txt`.
  Conflicts compare vanilla and mod bindings, context and modifiers, excluding unbound and both-default pairs.
  `host.mod_key(mod_id, id)` returns the saved or declared `(key, ClientModifiers)`, or `None` for an unregistered id.
  Read one with `host.is_down(mod_id, id)` and `host.consume_click(mod_id, id)` (`KeyMapping.isDown`, `consumeClick`). Diverges from upstream: the old `mods` hook,
  `NativeMod.keys` and the Options > Mods key editor are removed, with no compatibility route.
- The `command` hook runs a client command: the local player's typed or clicked chat command, without its slash, before the server and the game's own commands see it; set `ran` when the mod ran it. Client-side, with the `ClientHost`. Contract version `2`: a mod written for `1` was given the side-typed host, and was also asked on a server for commands run there (command blocks, LAN guests, the console, the integrated server thread); now only the client asks, and only for its own player's commands.

- Recipes of any type (`RecipeManager.getAllRecipesFor`), vanilla's (`minecraft:smelting`, `minecraft:campfire_cooking`) and a mod's own (`mymod:crusher`, for a machine or an altar) through one read: `host.recipes_of_type("minecraft:smelting")` gives each recipe in force, in file order, as a `Recipe`: its `id`, `kind`, `group`, typed `ingredients` and `results` (for shaped, shapeless and cooking recipes, as the game parsed them; a recipe the game cannot parse is not in force and not listed), `cooking_time` and `experience` for the cooking types, and its file's `json`, which is all a mod's own type has. The recipes are those of `data/<namespace>/recipe/` in vanilla, content mods (`.hmod`) and the world's data packs, with data packs merged and load conditions held, so a pack's override or removal shows; a type nobody uses gives nothing. `Host::recipe_ingredient` and `Host::recipe_result` read the usual fields as JSON text, tags included (a bare id is read as `minecraft:`; items the game does not know are left out, and the helper returns `Ok(None)` if none is left). Invalid JSON returns `RecipeJsonError::InvalidJson` rather than panicking. The recipes are the server's table: on the server thread, a dedicated server or a LAN host; a client, the single-player window included, sees vanilla's and the content mods' recipes, not the world's data packs', unless a mod had the server send it the type (`native_datapack_sync`). All three give nothing outside a world. The game crafts the recipes of its own types itself, and shows none of a mod's own in the recipe book; `/reload` reads a data pack's again, so look them up again when you need them. The lookup borrows the table, with no copy.

- [mobs](#mobs) for server mods: spawn one, read the mobs of a level in place, and move, hurt or remove one by its id.

- Redstone from a mod's block, on authoritative servers. `block_signal` may change the signal a block gives on
  a face, weak or direct, and `is_signal_source` lets redstone wire connect to it. Both are asked very often, so check the
  block first and answer from the mod's own state. When the output changes, and once the block is placed (a direct signal past a conductor isn't read before),
  `level.update_neighbors(host, pos, state, NeighbourUpdate::Neighbours)` makes the blocks around it read it again
  (`Level.updateNeighborsAt`; a block that powers what it is attached to, as a lever does, also updates there). A
  diode's front takes `level.neighbor_changed(host, front, state)` then `NeighbourUpdate::NeighboursExcept(facing)`
  (`DiodeBlock.updateNeighborsInFront`). Both act on the level in place and are refused elsewhere.

- Item behaviour, on the server for every player: `hurt_enemy` hears a player's hit land on a mob with the
  held stack, `inventory_tick` runs each tick, on the `ItemPart`s of every stack a player carries (armour and off hand included), and
  the stack is the place `ItemPlace::PlayerSlot { player, slot }`, read and written as any item place, and
  `on_equip` hears an equipment slot take a different item.

- Hearing players and mobs on the server for every player: `player_died`, `mob_spawned`,
  `mob_killed` (a player's melee blow, a sweep or a spear thrust too),
  `item_toss` (`ItemTossEvent`: a throw, with the item entity made but not yet in the level, which the `item_entity_*` methods read and change; not the items scattered when a player dies; `canceled` keeps the entity out of the level and the items are lost) and `item_picked_up` (the ground item entity; `can_pickup`: `False` leaves the stack on the ground, `True` takes it despite its pickup delay or another player's target), then `item_picked_up_post` (`ItemEntityPickupEvent.Post`: the same item entity, a copy of the stack before the pickup and the live remainder on it, which a listener may set; heard only when the whole stack went in, never on a partial pickup). They name a player by UUID.

- [Server data reload listeners](#server-data-reload-listeners) read a mod's pack resources with datapack overrides, once per reload.
- [Client asset reload listeners](#client-asset-reload-listeners) read a mod's pack resources with resource-pack overrides, once per reload.

- The item entities near a block, for machines that pick up items as a hopper does:
  `native_item_entities(dimension, min, max)` lists those whose box meets `min`..`max` (vanilla's
  `Level.getEntitiesOfClass(ItemEntity.class, box)`), each with its entity ID, position, stack and pickup delay, and
  `ItemEntityRef::set_stack` changes one's nonempty stack; discarding an entity is a separate operation. The query acts on
  the level in place.

- `LevelRef::with_random(host, |random| ...)`, the server level's own random (vanilla's `Level.random`, NeoForge mods'
  `level.getRandom()`): a mod draws from the stream vanilla's explosions and block drops use, so its draws shift theirs
  as a Java mod's would. The closure draws on the level's stream and the level keeps it after (`random(host)` is a copy
  of it, `set_random(host, random)` stores one back), also for a level parked while the server ticks another. It is `None` on a client of a server, for a stale handle and for a level that isn't open:
  the Nether and the End open when someone first goes there and close after 300 ticks with nobody in them. Inside a
  restricted level hook, `with_random` on the `LevelRandomHost` draws from the same stream.

- Server lifecycle hooks run once per start, on both the single-player server thread and a dedicated server.
  `server_about_to_start(dedicated)` runs before worlds load (`ServerAboutToStartEvent`), immediately followed by
  `server_starting(dedicated)` (`ServerStartingEvent`), before the server accepts play. `server_started(dedicated)`
  keeps its existing firing point: every level loaded and the first tick not yet run (`ServerStartedEvent`).
  On every exit after startup began, including a failed open, failed tick, or caught panic,
  `server_stopping(dedicated)` (`ServerStoppingEvent`) runs before player cleanup and the final world save attempt.
  `server_stopped(dedicated)` (`ServerStoppedEvent`) runs last, after network teardown, flushing saves and releasing
  storage, even when the save failed or a shutdown listener panicked. An early callback panic (including
  `config_unloading`) still reaches the final adopted-world save attempt and full server/network teardown,
  not just unpublishing or flushing queued writes. The first failure is retained if cleanup also fails.
  These are server-side, mutable `ServerHost` notifications, not cancellable.
  A failed open never overwrites a world the server did not successfully adopt: the session lock is taken before the prepared level is installed, and only that installation allows the final save. `WorldOpenFailed` or `WorldCloseFailed`
  still reports the failure; `WorldCloseFinal` is only emitted after a successful orderly close. No tick-time cost:
  these hooks dispatch only at server startup and shutdown.

- Mod block entities are sent to clients. Only declared types receive wire IDs after vanilla's, and several valid
  blocks can share a type. Server and client use its declared identity; `block_entity` supplies only initial data.
  `block_entity_update_tag` gives what clients get of one (`BlockEntity.getUpdateTag`, read from the block entity
  alone): it is asked when a chunk holding it is sent and when its block changes, and the client merges it into the
  copy's `nbt`. A saved chunk sent past the view distance asks it on its own thread, so read only `entity`. Keep it to what clients show (a machine running, its facing, a tank's level), not a menu's progress:
  menus have their own data slots. `block_entity_data_received` notices merged client data with a `Chunk` or `UpdatePacket` source; empty chunk tags and absent packet tags are silent, while empty packet compounds notify. Related `IBlockEntityExtension.onDataPacket` and `handleUpdateTag` perform loading, not this post-merge notice; they are not counterparts.

- One-shot fields ride that tag. `entity.set_client_update_fields(fields)` on a `ModBlockEntityView` queues them in
  the runtime under the entity's identity, for native and wasm mods alike; they are not part of the plain-data entity,
  so saves, clones and comparisons never see them and its revision stays. Once a block change (`block_entity_sync`)
  reaches viewers, the game builds one tag, puts the fields over `block_entity_update_tag`'s and sends it to
  them all. A change nobody sees, a chunk send and a single player's resend leave them waiting; removal or unload drops them.

- `affect_neighbors_after_removal` is a mod block's `Block.affectNeighborsAfterRemoval`: the block was
  removed from `pos` (`moved`: a piston pushed it) with `UPDATE_NEIGHBORS` or the piston flag. There is no bus
  event for it, so it is a `BlockPart` method only. The block's own class has already run its updates, as an
  override's `super` call; the part then pushes onto `updates` what it wants, in order: `NeighbourUpdate::OutputSignal`
  (`updateNeighbourForOutputSignal`), `Neighbours` (`updateNeighborsAt`) and `NeighboursExcept(direction)`
  (`updateNeighborsAtExceptFromFacing`), and the level runs each at once with vanilla's own functions. It runs
  inside the level's write with the level host, so it reads but cannot write blocks or spawn entities; a mod that
  needs either reports the gap on #44. The cost with no part on the block is one `has_part_hook` read.

- `pre_remove_side_effects` is a mod block entity's `BlockEntity.preRemoveSideEffects`: its block is being
  replaced or broken with side effects (not under flag 256). Its part puts the stacks it held in `drops`, and they
  scatter as `Containers.dropItemStack` scatters them, after the block entity's own container slots. It runs inside
  the level's write with the level host, like `neighbor_changed`; the block entity is still in place, so the part
  reads its attachments with `TYPE.get(host, Holder::BlockEntity(pos))`, the level host being their store. A part that returns nothing draws nothing.
  A block entity that removes its own block during its `block_entity_tick` or `menu_button` is out of the level for
  that call, so its part isn't asked: its attachments go with it, and only its container slots come back out.

- `visuals`: a world-frame hook that appends block-rim and
  colored-light requests (`BlockRim::new(pos, argb, width)`,
  `ColoredLight::new(at, rgb, radius, intensity)`). Rims trace the client's existing block outline edges,
  depth-tested against terrain. Lights add camera-local RGB illumination to the
  normal terrain/entity shaders, not gameplay light. Only the first eight rims
  and eight lights are examined; positions must be within 32 blocks of the player,
  values must be finite and bounded, and source chunks must be loaded. At most
  256 rim edges and 16 colored lights are rendered. Requests are frame-local,
  so disabling a native mod or leaving the world clears them without a retained
  state. Helpers `native_lit_block_name` and `native_flame_particle` read loaded
  blocks and emit a nearby vanilla flame particle; native mods must rate-limit
  emission. It also adds `emissive`: a world-frame hook for at most 32 pairs of
  already-loaded terrain sprites. Transparent pixels in an overlay leave its
  base unchanged; opaque pixels are drawn full-bright without changing gameplay
  light or the surrounding rock. The source pack must supply the overlay texture
  under `assets/<namespace>/textures/emissive/`. When no mod requests overlays,
  the terrain shader skips the lookup.
  When a native mod bundles a Horizon shader pack, naming its folder
  `native-<mod-id>` makes the Mods On/Off control pause that pack too (without
  changing the player's saved shader selection); other packs are unaffected.

### Custom ingredient metadata
`ingredient` and `ingredient_test` carry an API `Compound`. Recipe JSON is
converted at load by the shared JsonOps-to-NbtOps boundary; mod code matches
`Tag` variants rather than JSON fields. Nested null refuses the recipe as an
unclaimed kind does; numeric and heterogeneous arrays remain lists. Matching
borrows the retained compound and never converts metadata on the tick."#]
