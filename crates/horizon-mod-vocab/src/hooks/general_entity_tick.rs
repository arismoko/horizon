    /// its vehicle inside the vehicle's own tick, depth-first as

    /// joined this tick tick from the next, parked levels and rows outside
    /// entity-ticking chunks do not tick, and a `entity_tick_pre` that

    /// row's data through its attachments (`event.entity` is their holder);

    /// types: vanilla families tick their own paths (#6509 owns bringing
    /// them to one join-order walk), so a part attached to `minecraft:zombie`
    /// hears no tick from this hook. Server-side.
