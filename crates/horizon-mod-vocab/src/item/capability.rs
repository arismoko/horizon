//! Capability parts (arismoko/horizon#41 §7): providers a mod registers for its block entity
//! type or its block to answer a capability, such as [`ITEMS`], beside the game's own
//! (NeoForge's `RegisterCapabilitiesEvent`). A handler holds no borrow of the game: each call
//! is given the host, so a handler may look up and call a neighbour's capability (a pipe), and
//! it keeps its state where the game keeps the block entity's (its slots, its saved compound, its
//! attachments).
