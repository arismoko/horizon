//! Bulk item storage: [`STORAGE`], a block's items by kind, in 64-bit amounts and without slots,
//! for the stores, pipes and networks of a large base. Every block entity with slots answers it
//! through the game's own adapter over [`ITEMS`], so a pipe reaches a chest and a mod's drive
//! through one capability; a mod's bulk store (drawers, a drive, a vault) answers it itself, one
//! entry per kind however many items it holds.
//!
//! **Diverges from upstream: Horizon addition.** NeoForge 26.3's transfer API has no by-kind
//! capability; `ITEMS` (`Capabilities.Item.BLOCK`) is its counterpart and stays as it is.
//!
//! What a call costs is the handler's. A bulk store keyed by kind answers a question about one
//! kind, and a move of one kind, in constant time whatever it holds. The game's own adapter
//! answers each question in one pass over the slots the side reaches (O(slots), with no work per
//! item moved); a mod's `ITEMS` handler wrapped by kind is asked slot by slot. [`transfer`] is
//! four handler calls whatever it moves. A listing comes a [`StoragePage`] at a time, never
//! longer than [`MAX_STORAGE_PAGE`] entries, whatever a caller asks.
//!
//! **When not to use it.** A pipe that moves a few items a tick between small containers is
//! cheaper on `ITEMS` and [`move_resources`](crate::move_resources), slot by slot: in the
//! measurements behind this API, 256 pipes moving 8 items a tick each cost 2.8 ms a tick that
//! way against 3.7 ms through `STORAGE`. `STORAGE` pays off for bulk stores, large moves, and
//! networks that sleep while idle.
