//! Commands and their authority.

/// A command a native mod adds, as one usage: words, then arguments
/// `<name:kind>`, optional ones last in brackets `[name:kind]`:
/// `pay <player:player> <amount:integer>`, `balance [player:player]`,
/// `eco give <player:player> <amount:integer>`. Kinds: `word`, `text` (the
/// rest of the line, last), `integer`, `number`, `boolean`, `player`, `players`,
/// `entity`, `entities`, `item`, `block_pos`, `mod_id` (a loaded package id, delivered as a
/// string), `resource:<registry>` (an id that registry holds, delivered as `Id`:
/// `<kind:resource:minecraft:entity_type>`), or a command argument type a mod registered with
/// `Registrar::register_command_argument`, named by its namespaced id:
/// `machine use <machine:mymod:machine>`. Usages of one command share their
/// words; the server merges them into one tree. Each executable usage keeps its own level:
/// a public `foo bar` lets everyone traverse `foo`, but does not make an
/// operator-only `foo` executable. Optional arguments also allow execution at
/// their preceding prefixes, at that usage's level.
///
/// Side: server. Selector arguments use vanilla's source position, permissions,
/// cardinality and selection order; `player`/`entity` require one result and
/// `players`/`entities` require a nonempty result. Unresolvable entity handles are
/// omitted; lists have no extra cap beyond the wire frame limits.
