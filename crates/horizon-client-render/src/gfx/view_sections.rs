//! Each world view's own section list (#3773): the frame keeps the player camera's culling (the
//! caves, occlusion, faces turned away, GPU culling) while views are asked for, and each view
//! walks the resident columns once more with its own frustum, whose near plane is its clip plane
//! (`world_views::ViewCamera`). No occlusion graph and no faces left out: a portal's camera
//! usually sits inside a wall, behind its clip plane, and a mirrored view needs nothing more.
//! Its draws go after the frame's and the shadow camera's, as the shadow pass's go after the
//! frame's, and its translucent sections go back to front from its own camera.
