//! Parts (arismoko/horizon#41): code a mod attaches to one block, block entity, item or mod
//! menu type at startup. The scoped hooks ask the parts attached to the thing they are about,
//! after every mod's `Hooks` method. Parts attached by tag are resolved by each game against its
//! own tags, at world open and on `/reload`, into a table kept by that game's thread; that table
//! also indexes the block parts by state, so the state-keyed hooks look theirs up without the
//! block's name.
