//! The Horizon mod API: the one crate a Horizon code mod depends on.
//!
//! Horizon is Minecraft: Java Edition 26.3 written in Rust. A code mod is a Rust crate that implements
//! [`Hooks`], built either natively by the Horizon launcher or to `mod.wasm` for the game's sandbox. Both
//! targets use this same API; only the build differs. Add it to your mod's `Cargo.toml` as
//! `horizon-mod-api` (the library name is `mod_api`).
//!
//! The [modding book](https://arismoko.github.io/horizon/) is the guide: start with
//! [Your first native mod](https://arismoko.github.io/horizon/start/first-mod.html). This reference documents
//! every item of the API.
//!
//! # A first mod
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use mod_api::{self, Hooks, PlayerLoggedInEvent, ServerHost, Text};
//!
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! struct Mod;
//!
//! #[mod_api::horizon_mod]
//! impl Hooks for Mod {
//!     /// A player joined the server: greet them.
//!     fn player_logged_in(&self, host: &mut dyn ServerHost, event: &mut PlayerLoggedInEvent<'_>) {
//!         let line = format!("greeter says hello, {}!", event.name);
//!         if let Some(player) = host.player(event.player) {
//!             let _ = player.tell(host, Text::literal(line));
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `#[horizon_mod]` marks the one `impl Hooks` at the crate root and subscribes the mod to exactly the hooks it
//! implements. The book's examples crate compiles this mod against the API.
//!
//! # Where to start
//!
//! | Item | What it is |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`Hooks`] | Every moment a mod can answer, one method each, with its side, its NeoForge 26.3 counterpart and whether it can be cancelled. |
//! | [`BlockPart`], [`ItemPart`], [`BlockEntityPart`], [`MenuPart`], [`EntityPart`] | Behaviour for the objects a mod attaches a Part to. |
//! | [`Registrar`] | What a mod declares in [`Hooks::register`]: registry keys, Parts and settings. |
//! | [`Host`], [`ServerHost`], [`ClientHost`] | The game as a hook sees it, split by side so a call on the wrong side does not compile. |
//! | [`AttachmentType`] | Data a mod keeps on levels, chunks, entities and other holders. |
//! | [`Wire`](derive@Wire) | The derive that lets a mod's own values cross to and from a WebAssembly mod. |
//!
//! An item whose documentation says **Not on wasm** is unavailable to WebAssembly mods.
