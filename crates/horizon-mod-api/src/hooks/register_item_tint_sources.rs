    #[notes = r#"## Item tint sources

An item tint source (NeoForge's `RegisterColorHandlersEvent.ItemTintSources`) colours a greyscale item per
stack, in two steps as well: `Hooks::register_item_tint_sources` pushes its id once at start, before resources
load, and `Hooks::item_tint_source` answers the ARGB colour for each stack, in hand, in a screen or on the ground.

```rust,ignore
fn register_item_tint_sources(
    &self,
    _context: &RegistrationContext,
    event: &mut RegisterItemTintSourcesEvent<'_>,
) {
    event.sources.push("example:charge".into());
}

fn item_tint_source(&self, _host: &dyn ClientHost, event: &mut ItemTintSourceEvent<'_>) {
    if event.source == "example:charge" {
        let rgb = event.config["default"].as_i64().unwrap_or(0xFFFFFF) as u32;
        let rgb = if event.stack.count() > 1 { 0x55FF55 } else { rgb };
        event.color = 0xFF000000 | rgb;
    }
}
```

Use it as an entry of a `minecraft:model`'s `tints`, `{"type": "example:charge", "default": 65280}`: the entry's
place in the list is the `tintindex` it colours, and its object reaches the hook as `event.config`. A resource
reload keeps reading the mod's colour. Ids are checked as for numeric properties. A source no mod registers draws
white, decided once at load, and so does an entry no mod answers; an item with no mod source never reaches the hook."#]
