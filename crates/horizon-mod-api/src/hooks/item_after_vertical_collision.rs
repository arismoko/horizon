//! Fork-shaped conversion of the upstream declaration.

pub trait Hooks {
    /// `native_item_after_vertical_collision` lends a dropped item's active stack after vertical collision response, before block effects, merging and pickup. The block is the one selected by the legacy on-position query. `client` identifies prediction. Set `discard` (trait `Flow::Cancel`) or set the stack to None to consume the item without loot or pickup. A movement skipped by the normal item tick sends no notification. Bundles need "hooks": @API:item_after_vertical_collision@.
