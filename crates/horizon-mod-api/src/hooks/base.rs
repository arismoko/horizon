Farmers recognize mod blocks made from farmland and `CropBlock` templates, including declarations from
`native_blocks`. A crop block's generated item is its seed: add that item to
`minecraft:villager_plantable_seeds` to let farmers plant its default block state from their inventory.
Untagged items and tagged items without a block are skipped. Crop maturity follows the template's class:
beetroots mature at age 3, ordinary crops at 7; torchflower crops never reach their maximum age 2 while
still crops. Pitcher crops are not `CropBlock`s and are not harvested by this behavior. Farming still
requires a farmer at work and `mob_griefing` enabled."#]
