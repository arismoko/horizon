    /// asked either way, as NeoForge's is. `player` and `player_entity_id` are the local player's,
    /// `None` for the recipe book's search text, which has none and drops the colours, and for a stack
    /// nested in another's tooltip (a crossbow's loaded projectile); `advanced`
    /// (F3+H) and `creative` (a creative tab's own slot) are the tooltip's `TooltipFlag`. Asked
    /// each frame the tooltip shows, only while a mod listens. Client-side.
