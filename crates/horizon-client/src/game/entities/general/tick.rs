//! PURPOSE: the general entity rows' authoritative tick (#792 stage 4): one
//! pass over the rows in join order, each root's rider subtree inside its
//! tick.
//! WHY: vanilla `ServerLevel.tick` walks `entityTickList.forEach`, and
//! `tickNonPassenger` runs the entity's common tick, its tick, then each
//! rider recursively (`tickPassenger`: a rider is never a root). The tick
//! list is insertion-ordered, and its `ensureActiveIsNotIterated` keeps a
//! join made during the pass out of the pass, so Horizon's join order
//! (`join_seq.rs`) is that order and a row that joins mid-pass first ticks
//! the next pass.
//! REFS: vanilla `ServerLevel.tick`, `tickNonPassenger`, `tickPassenger`,
//! `EntityTickList`; `join_seq.rs`; `ordered_tick.rs`; `tools/rea_vanilla.py`
//! (`add` appends to the active map, `remove` takes out, and the passive
//! swap holds a mid-pass join for the next tick).
//! LOGS: none. READS-BY: `Game::tick_world`. ENDS-WHEN: every kind ticks
//! from the join-order walk.
