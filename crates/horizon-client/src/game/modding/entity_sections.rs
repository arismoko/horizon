//! `entity_entering_section` (`EntityEvent.EnteringSection`): vanilla tells it from
//! `Entity.setPosRaw`, whose `EntityInLevelCallback.onMove` (`PersistentEntitySectionManager`'s
//! callback on a server, `TransientEntitySectionManager`'s on a client) compares the section the
//! entity is filed under with the one its new position is in, and moves it at once when they
//! differ. Horizon's kinds keep their positions in their own fields, so the hook is told from
//! the places that write them: [`EntitySections`] files each entity under its section, and each
//! position-write boundary hands it the entity's new position immediately after the write.
//!
//! The boundaries: an entity joining (the server's `native_joins_flush`, a client's
//! `AddEntity`) files it untold. The mob and item loops report each committed write while their
//! rows are resident again; minecarts, boats and the remaining server entities report after each
//! entity's own update. A client reports interpolation writes per entity. A teleport, a piston
//! push, a mod's position write, each move a server player sent and each packet that moves an
//! entity on a client are one each.
//! Every boundary that sees another section records a crossing from the section the entity was
//! filed under and tells it before the write returns, so two moves told apart are two crossings,
//! and a move out and back is two.
//!
//! A listener runs synchronously after the new section is filed. What it moves or removes is
//! deferred by the surrounding entity write and is never re-entered from its own call; listeners
//! should queue such work themselves until the write completes.
//!
//! With no listener each boundary is one subscription check and nothing is filed. With one, a
//! boundary is a hash lookup and the reusable crossing record is told without a per-frame scan.
