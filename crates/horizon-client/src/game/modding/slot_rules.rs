//! `menu_slot_rules` on the game's side. A menu click cannot reach the game, so the game lends
//! itself to the click as its [`SlotRules`] (`Env::slot_rules`), with the read-only `Host`
//! behind it: the click asks while it plans, once for each slot and stack it consults, and the
//! answers stay in what it planned. A menu type no part answers is never asked, and nothing is
//! converted for it.
