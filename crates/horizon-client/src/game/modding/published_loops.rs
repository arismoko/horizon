//! Published loops (`[[native.loop]]`): hot loops the game owns, with a slot a native mod's helper
//! fills. Like every `[[native.*]]` table this is game code by another route, pinned to the exact
//! build: a loop's slot trait and cursor live beside the loop (`block_entity_ticks.rs` for
//! `block_entities.tick`) and lend the slot the loop's own state, and nothing here is `mod_api`.
//!
//! A loop is written once as a function generic over its slot; its entry, marked
//! `#[horizon_loop]`, calls it with `()`, which compiles to the game's own loop. A mod build compiles
//! one copy of the entry that runs the loop with the installed slots, nested by `(priority, mod
//! id)` (`(A, (B, ()))`: the first answer that is not [`LoopFlow::Continue`] wins), and installs it
//! through the entry's replacement cell. Their state is one value per `Game` (this file), so a
//! single-player process's client and server games never share one.
