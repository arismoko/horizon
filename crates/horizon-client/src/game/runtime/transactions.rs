//! `host.transaction` (#41 §7): NeoForge 26.3's `Transaction` and `SnapshotJournal`, kept by
//! the game at the storage level, so a mod's handlers hold no state and write no journal.
//!
//! A write through a capability helper inside a transaction applies in place, so later steps
//! see it; the first write to a storage at each depth keeps that storage as it was. What a
//! write would tell the world (`setChanged` and comparators, a jukebox starting or stopping, a
//! cauldron's block update, an item dropped) waits for the root commit and then runs once,
//! as `SnapshotJournal.onRootCommit` does. A nested commit hands its snapshots and waiting
//! work to the transaction around it; an abort puts every storage back quietly and drops the
//! waiting work, which nothing outside had seen.
//!
//! Covered here: block entities (slots, saved compound, custom name, lock, loot roll, attachments), a hopper's cooldown and
//! cauldron and composter block states. The attachment map of every other holder (an entity, a player, a
//! chunk, the level) is kept on the first access to it through `attachment_map`. A block's tentative state is stored only (`World::set_stored`): the
//! one real write, with its remesh, relight and logs, is at the root commit. A jukebox is
//! told at the root commit from its record before and after, so a disc swapped in one
//! transaction changes the song. A player's inventory (slots, armour, off hand, cursor) is kept
//! whole on its first write, from wherever the player's state lives then: the local player's or
//! a guest's, swapped in by `native_as_player`. An item a write drops from a player waits for
//! the root commit too. An item entity's stack is kept on its first write; one emptied stays,
//! empty, until the root commit removes it. A guest's menu storage (ender chest, crafting grid,
//! a mod's chest menu) is kept whole on its first write through a menu slot; a crafting grid
//! changed by the transaction has its result made again at the root commit.
//! `LivingRef::set_health` keeps the player's synced float storage and unpublished update
//! events, or the mob's health and sync dirtiness. This does not journal other health,
//! damage, death or attribute operations.
