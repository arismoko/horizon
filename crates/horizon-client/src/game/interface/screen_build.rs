//! A screen's built state (`Screen.init`): made when the screen opens, remade
//! when the window or the GUI scale resizes it, dropped when it closes.
//!
//! Step 1 of #903 put the seam in: every screen built `BuildLayout::Empty`,
//! with the window's rectangle and nothing a screen drew or hit-tested.
//! Step 2 moves the container screens onto it (`BuildLayout::Container`): the
//! panel, the book and effect panels beside it, the creative tab rows and
//! every slot's hover box are made once here, and the drawing, the hit tests
//! and `screen_exclusion` read them instead of rebuilding them per call.
//! Step 3 adds the pause menu. Step 4 takes chat's and the command block
//! screen's resize out of their draws: their text boxes are re-made at the
//! build's size here (`ChatScreen.resize`,
//! `AbstractCommandBlockEditScreen.resize`), and their buttons are laid out
//! once per build.
