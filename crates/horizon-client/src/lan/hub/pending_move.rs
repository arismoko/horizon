//! With a listener, a validated report that changes the player's position or look is not committed
//! in the poll. The hub keeps it on the guest, tells the game ([`HostEvent::PlayerMove`]) and stops
//! reading that guest's inbox, so the player's later reports stay in order behind it; the game rules
//! on it in the same tick and the inbox goes on from there (the turn pauses as it does for a raw
//! payload). The game
//! fires the hook with nothing of the hub borrowed and calls [`Hub::resolve_move`]: commit, or drop
//! and correct the client to the accepted position and look. With no listener nothing is held:
//! [`Hub::accept_move`] commits at once, as it did before the hook existed.
//!
//! Not heard, and committed in place: a player's first tick in a level (the tick after a join or a
//! level change), the confirmation of a teleport, and a passage crossing. A report that arrives
//! while a teleport is unconfirmed never gets here (the hub only applies its rotation), so the
//! correction a veto sends is not heard either.
