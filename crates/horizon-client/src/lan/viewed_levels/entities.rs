//! The entities of a viewed level (#3716, 9d): a client that views the level in place from
//! another tracks its entities as one more viewer of the level's tracking pass (`Entities::tick`),
//! with its view's own tracker and chunks, and is sent their packets wrapped in runs.
//!
//! It tracks an entity as Immersive Portals' chunk tracking does (`MixinTrackedEntity`): the
//! entity's chunk was sent to the view, and an area there holds it within the entity's tracking
//! range, `distanceToSource * 16 + 8 <= range`, with the distance in chunks from the area's
//! centre. A view tracks at most `viewed_levels::MAX_ENTITIES`. Its trackers' start and stop
//! events go to no mod: a mod hears only of the player's own level.
//!
//! An entity of a `Loaded` area is sent and stands still: nothing ticks there.
