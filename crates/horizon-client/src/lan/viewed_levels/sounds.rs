//! A viewed level's sounds (#3983, gap 12). Besides vanilla's broadcast in their own level, the
//! sounds at a position go wrapped to the players whose clients view that level and hold its
//! chunk, within the broadcast distance plus 16 blocks of the view's centre chunk. The client
//! asks its mods where in its own level to play
//! each one (`viewed_level_sound`). Only a client that answered revision 3 is sent them
//! (`Answer::sounds`); one of revision 1 or 2 still views the level and hears none of it. A sound
//! bound to an entity goes, by the same rule, only to a view that tracks the entity (9d), as its
//! client can place it only then.
