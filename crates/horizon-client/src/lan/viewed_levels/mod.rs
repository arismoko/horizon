//! Viewed levels, server side (#3716): levels besides their own that players' clients keep, so
//! that the server can send them those levels' chunks and updates on `horizon:levels`
//! (`horizon_protocol::viewed_levels`).
//!
//! A mod asks for areas of chunks for one player in any level (`Hub::set_viewed_areas`). They hold
//! their own tickets (`ticket_levels::Sources::viewed`) and loading squares (`Streaming.extra`),
//! never the forced chunks' or the mods' chunk tickets, and they live apart from what makes a
//! player count in a level (`Guest::placed_in`, `Guest::watches_level`): an area is not a player
//! for spawning, sleeping, raids or any other rule. A client whose capability answer allows it is
//! sent the areas of the levels it is not in, each packet wrapped with its level (`send`).
//!
//! With no area on the server, a level pass costs one integer compare ([`ViewedLevels::active`]).
