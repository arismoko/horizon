//! Which chunks tick, from the chunk tickets of `DistanceManager`.
//!
//! Every player holds two kinds of ticket:
//! - `PLAYER_LOADING` at level 31 (`ENTITY_TICKING`) on every chunk within
//!   the server's view distance (Chebyshev), from `PlayerTicketTracker`;
//! - `PLAYER_SIMULATION` at level `31 - simulationDistance` on its own chunk.
//!
//! A `/forceload`ed chunk holds a `FORCED` ticket at level 31 of both kinds.
//! An entity that came through a portal leaves a `PORTAL` ticket of radius 3
//! (`Entity.placePortalTicket`: level 30 of both kinds, for 300 ticks) on the
//! chunk it arrived in; it keeps that level running with no player in it.
//! A saved one comes back with the level and the ticks it had left.
//! The dragon fight holds a `DRAGON` ticket of radius 9 for as long as a player
//! watches it (`EnderDragonFight.tick`: level 24 of both kinds on the arena,
//! so its island ticks out to 7 chunks whatever the watcher's simulation
//! distance), and drops it when the last watcher goes.
//! A viewed area (#3716, `lan::viewed_levels`) is a ticket of its own, never a
//! player's: a `Loaded` one is `PLAYER_LOADING` alone, `FULL` (33) over its
//! square and no simulation; a `Ticking` one is `PLAYER_SIMULATION` too,
//! entity ticking (31) over its square, rising by one a ring outward.
//! Levels rise by one per chunk away from a ticket (`ChunkTracker`) and each
//! chunk takes the lowest. The loading level gives the chunk's
//! `FullChunkStatus` (`ChunkLevel.fullStatus`: 31 entity ticking, 32 block
//! ticking, 33 full) and the simulation level gives what
//! `inEntityTickingRange` (31 or less) and `inBlockTickingRange` (32 or less)
//! answer. Vanilla needs both:
//! - entities tick where both levels are entity ticking (`ServerLevel.tick`,
//!   and `EntityTickList` holds only the entities of entity-ticking chunks);
//! - random ticks run in the simulation tracker's entity-ticking chunks that
//!   have a ticking chunk (`ChunkMap.forEachBlockTickingChunk`);
//! - scheduled ticks, block events and block entities run where both are
//!   block ticking (`isPositionTickingWithEntitiesLoaded`,
//!   `shouldTickBlocksAt`, `LevelChunk.isTicking`).
//!
//! Whoever the players are (the local player, LAN guests, a dedicated
//! server's players), they count the same.
