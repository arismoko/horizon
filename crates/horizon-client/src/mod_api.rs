//! Trait mods implement `Hooks` and link into the game executable.
//! The executable passes the ordered `Mods` to `entry::main_with`.
//! Trait mods are process-wide, like mixin module statics.
//! Hooks use `&self + Send + Sync` for shared and reentrant calls; see `docs/native-mods.md`.
//! Generate the trait and dispatch with `cargo run -p xtask -- mod-api`.
//! `Host` is hand-written for this slice; a later change will generate it from native helpers.
