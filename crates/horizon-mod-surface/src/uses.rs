//! What a mod uses of a surface, and whether it fits another build's surface (design §10.3).
//!
//! [`uses_contained`] scans a mod's Rust source ([`crate::scan`]) and lists the surface records it names,
//! then every record their signatures reference, transitively ([`Surface::closure`]). A record
//! counts when its name occurs as an identifier in the source or the manifest names it, with two
//! narrowings:
//! - a member (a trait method, an inherent item, an associated item, a field, a variant, a hook's
//!   argument) counts only when its owner trait, type or hook is reached from what counts,
//!   through the supertraits of called traits too ([`Surface::reach`]): a sub-host trait's method
//!   called on `&mut dyn ServerHost` counts once `ServerHost` does;
//! - a name written after `X::`, where `X` owns a member of that name, is that member only
//!   (`TextHover::Item` is the variant, not a type `Item`).
//!
//! For each struct the source names it also records how the mod builds it, read with a Rust
//! parser ([`crate::syntax`]): [`Built::Full`] where a struct literal or call lists its fields
//! with no `..` (`Name { … }`, `Name::<T> { … }`, `Name(…)`, `Self { … }` in an impl for it, a
//! local alias or renamed import of it), where a pattern matches it exhaustively (`let Name { a }
//! = …`, `Name(a, b) =>`), or where a tuple or unit struct's name stands as a value (`.map(Pos)`,
//! `Marker`); [`Built::Base`] when every literal ends in a base (and for a union, whose literal
//! names one field); [`Built::None`] otherwise. A pattern ending in `..` is a read. Which struct a
//! name means is decided by two rules, with no module resolution:
//! - a name written with a path (`a::b::Name`) is every API struct of that name;
//! - an unqualified name (or `Self` in an impl for one) is the mod's own type only in a file
//!   that defines it at its top level under no `#[cfg]`, binds it with no `use`, has no glob, no
//!   inline module, no `use` with a metavariable, and only standard or API macros and attributes
//!   whose names nothing in the mod rebinds, in a mod with no `include!`. Otherwise it is every
//!   API struct of that name.
//!
//! The parser does not expand macros, so what it cannot see is counted as doubt, never as
//! fitting, because a refusal is safe and a wrong "fits" is not:
//! - a macro body's tokens are read as they stand: an API struct name in one followed by `{` or
//!   `(` is a build, in full unless it ends in `..`, and so is a tuple or unit struct's name
//!   where a value starts (`.map(Pos)`); a literal of a name the scan cannot place there (a
//!   metavariable's `$t { … }` or `$t(…)`, a struct of an unknown name) builds every buildable
//!   API struct the mod names in full;
//! - so does a `Self { … }` the scan cannot tie to an impl of a plain path, and a literal of a
//!   `type` alias whose target is not a plain path;
//! - a file holding a macro or attribute that is neither standard, the API's own nor the mod's
//!   own `macro_rules!` (a dependency's macro, an unknown derive or attribute macro), or a `use`
//!   with a metavariable, builds in full every buildable API struct it names, since that
//!   expansion may build it.
//!
//! Names assembled inside a macro from outside the mod (`paste!`, `concat_idents!`) never appear
//! in the source and are out of the scan's reach; the compile catches them. A file that does not
//! parse, or nests deeper than [`syntax::MAX_NESTING`], cannot be judged ([`ScanError`]), and
//! neither can any file where the parser cannot have a stack of its own (on wasm). Even a mod
//! judged to fit is compiled on the player's machine against the target build, and that compile
//! stays the final check. The scan also records the public paths the mod writes each item by:
//! imported, written out, under an API glob (`prelude::Biome` after `use mod_api::*`), or
//! through an API module or glob the mod re-exports (`crate::prelude::Biome` after
//! `pub use mod_api::prelude`, `crate::Biome` after `pub use mod_api::prelude::*`).
//!
//! [`fits`] compares such a list with a target build's surface. The mod fits when every entry
//! exists there with an equal hash and under every path the mod writes, every type keeps the
//! trait impls it had, every struct the mod builds can still be built and keeps its field set
//! when built in full, and every hook whose version the manifest names keeps that version. The
//! per-member hashes make this exact about additions: a new `Host` method or sub-host trait, a
//! new hook, a new hook argument, a new field on a struct the mod does not build in full, or a
//! new trait impl changes nothing for the mod.
//!
//! Whether a mod is exact by nature (a `[native.*]` table, internals) is the caller's to decide
//! from its manifest before asking, and such a mod gets no table: this crate does not read
//! manifests.
//!
//! A [`UsesTable`] is the list a package carries: schema, the build it was made for, and its
//! entries. [`UsesTable::read`] refuses an unknown schema, malformed JSON, repeated ids and
//! documents over [`MAX_USES_BYTES`] with a typed [`UsesError`].
