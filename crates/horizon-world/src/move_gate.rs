//! The gate one physical entity move goes through (#2414): what the move's
//! cause is and what the `entity_move` decision turned out to be, so the game
//! layer decides once and the kind's physics runs with the answer.
//!
//! The gate is plain data: it takes no borrow, allocates nothing and scans no
//! mod, so a move with no listener costs one branch. The client's
//! `move_gate` module arms it (and, from PR 1b on, fires the `entity_move`
//! hook there, in that one function) and is the only caller allowed to reach
//! the collide entries.
