"""The self-check to run before asking for review: one command, one block to paste into the pull request.

    python3 tools/pr_ready.py                       # on this machine, against origin/main
    python3 tools/pr_ready.py --base upstream/main  # a fork: against the main repository's main
    python3 tools/pr_ready.py --host macmini        # builds and harnesses on a fleet machine (~/fleet/rbuild)
    python3 tools/pr_ready.py --harnesses           # also run the affected vanilla harnesses here
    python3 tools/pr_ready.py --quick               # never run the vanilla harnesses

From the files the branch changes since its merge base with --base (committed or not) it decides what to run:
rustfmt, and clippy with warnings denied exactly as CI's verify job runs it (the whole workspace with the game's code
mods, plus the server build when horizon-client is affected); the tests of the touched crates, with the features
CI's workspace-wide run gives them; the launcher (its own workspace) the same way when CI's launcher job would run
(tools/ci/rust_changes.py --launcher); crates/horizon-theme/tokens.css against horizon-theme; Cargo.lock changing
only with a Cargo.toml; the Python tests (always, as in CI) and the public-tree check; and the vanilla harnesses the
changes can affect, picked as CI's parity job picks them (tools/parity.py --changed). As in CI (parity-scope in
.github/workflows/ci.yml), the harnesses run only when the branch changes a harness, an oracle, a probe or the
runner; otherwise they are listed and left to parity-main, which runs them on main. --harnesses runs them anyway.
Harnesses run where the vanilla data is (a prepared .local/ here, or the Mac mini); elsewhere they are listed for CI.
Tests select library, binary and integration targets explicitly, followed by doc tests, so unrelated example
executables are not built and linked again.

It prints one Markdown block for the pull request's body (stdout) and exits non-zero when a check fails.
Progress, and the end of a failed check's output, go to stderr (--verbose: all of it).
