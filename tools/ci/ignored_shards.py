"""Print the ignored-tests shard matrix: every shard, or the ones a pull request needs.

Usage:
  ignored_shards.py --matrix --all      `matrix=`, every shard and the daily-rows legs (the daily run)
  ignored_shards.py --prepare PACKAGE [ARG...]   run what PACKAGE's tests need built first (PREPARE), with ARGs
                                                 appended (`-j2`); nothing when it needs nothing
  ignored_shards.py --matrix BASE HEAD  `matrix=`, the shards this pull request must run

The ignored-tests check is a matrix with one package per shard; this file is the single
place that names them. A shard is selected when a changed crate is its package or a
transitive dependency of it. Workspace-wide files, and any path no crate owns, select
every shard; pushes to main always run everything (the `changes` job passes --all).
crates/horizon-client holds horizon-client-lib's sources too (its [lib] path reaches
into that tree), so that directory counts for both packages; the launcher is its own
workspace (launcher/Cargo.lock) and selects nothing.
