# ~/code/horizon-parity/shared-local; tools/ci/linux-runner.sh sets it on Linux). It is cloned once into the runner's
# work folder ($RUNNER_WORKSPACE/shared-local; APFS clones, or reflinks where the file system has them, so no second
# copy of the bytes), and .local/ links to it as in a parity worktree.
# .local/horizon-client and the exporter outputs beside it, what horizon-prepare makes, are prepared by this
# checkout's own preparer once per preparer version (its sources, the exporters and research-lock.json), so a
# change to the preparer is checked with what it prepares; the four newest preparations are kept on legacy runners.
# Dyna uses a per-slot HORIZON_PREPARED_CACHE and read-only HORIZON_SHARED_SOURCE; old keys stay until slot GC.
