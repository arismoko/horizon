"""The mod API surface report: what a pull request changes in what mods can name.

Exports the surface of the merge base and of the checked-out tree with the head's `horizon-stage`, diffs them, and
writes the classified report to the job summary. The base comes from the event: on `pull_request` the checkout is
GitHub's merge commit, whose first parent is the base; on a dispatch with `pr`, GitHub's compare API gives the merge
base of that pull request's head and its base branch. Only that one commit is fetched (`--depth 1`), and only its
`crates/` and `tools/layering` are unpacked.

It reports; it does not gate. It passes when the base cannot be found or fetched, or when the head's tool cannot read
the base tree (a change to the declaration format), saying so in one line. It fails for a new change note that names
an id that did not change or cannot be read, and, with `gate = true` in tools/ci/surface.toml, for a breaking change
no new note names.
