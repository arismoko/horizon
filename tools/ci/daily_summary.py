"""The daily run's summary (.github/workflows/daily.yml): the `daily-green` tag and one issue per failing test.

Reads this run's jobs (names, conclusions and step names from the Actions API, never a log) and the legs' verdict
files (tools/ci/ignored_tests.py --report: test identity, kind, panic location, policy file), then:
- every leg green: moves the tag `daily-green` to the commit;
- a failing test: files `Daily: <crate> <test>` (label `bug`) with its panic location, this run as the first that
  saw it and the pull requests merged since the last green daily as suspects, or comments on the open one;
- a leg that failed without a test name (build error, timeout, killed, cancelled, skipped, or a leg with no
  sanitised verdict): one issue per leg, `Daily: <leg> did not complete`, naming the failed steps and, for a shard,
  why each run stopped as its verdict file says (signal or exit status, memory peak and limit, wall time, the tests
  still running past 60 s; stopped_text); a leg whose red asks for an action is titled as that action (ACTIONS:
  `Daily: update the machine sample for the mod API change`);
- a test (or leg) green again: closes its open issue with a comment.
A job it does not know, or an expected leg with no job, is a red leg ("did not report"), never green; so is a
shard of the matrix (tools/ci/ignored_shards.py, which builds it) with no job of its name. Each comment
names this run's URL, and none is posted twice for one run (a rerun of failed jobs, or a retry after a partial
write, completes what is missing). `daily_summary.py --seen SHA` prints a completed real daily run of SHA, if any.
`daily_summary.py --after JOB RESULT` reports a job that runs after the summary (the SDK's publish, `sdk-publish`) the
same way: not `success` files or comments on `Daily: JOB did not complete`, naming its failed steps; `success` closes
it.
Only a run on refs/heads/main with DRY_RUN=false writes; otherwise it prints what it would do to the job summary.
Lookups come first and fail the job on any API error (a rate limit included), so a failed lookup never files
duplicates.

Environment: GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_RUN_ID, GITHUB_REF, GITHUB_SERVER_URL, GH_TOKEN, COMMIT, DRY_RUN,
RESULTS (toJSON(needs)), REPORTS (the downloaded daily-report-* artifacts), GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY, GITHUB_OUTPUT.
