"""Run every library test, ignored or not, with the prepared vanilla data, against a list of known failures.

Usage: ignored_tests.py SHARD...  (HORIZON_TEST_RESOURCES points at the prepared 26.3 data)
       ignored_tests.py --needs VARIABLE (--one-process-each | --list) [--jobs N]

A SHARD is a package, or one leg of it written `PACKAGE#NofM` (tools/ci/ignored_shards.py splits the biggest
package so one process does not hold every test's memory). A leg runs the tests whose name hashes to its
number, so every test runs in exactly one leg, and only judges the list's entries for those same tests.
An unqualified horizon-client-lib runs two such selections consecutively on the same runner, releasing
retained fixture memory between processes without adding a matrix job.

Each package's library tests run with `--include-ignored`: the #[ignore]d ones that need the data, and the
ones that return early without it, which `verify` (no data) passes without checking anything. The packages
in INTEGRATION_TESTS also run their `tests/` integration tests. The job fails when a test fails that
no file in tools/ci/ignored-tests/ lists, when a listed test passes (take it off its file: the lists only
shrink), and when a listed test no longer exists. A test marked `flaky` there
may pass or fail; one marked `harness` is a parity harness's step, run by its harness with the
environment it sets, and is skipped here, as is one marked `manual` (run by hand, by its parent test, or by the
workflow its row names); one marked `needs` reads an input only its parity harness provides
(REFERENCE names the environment variable): without that variable it is refused by name at the start of the
shard, and with it, it runs and must pass; one marked `gpu` needs a graphics adapter and runs only where
the runner has a Vulkan driver (an ICD file), and must pass there.

`needs-plain` is like `needs`, but selects a plain test without `--ignored`.

A row marked `daily` (`PACKAGE TEST TARGET daily REASON`, in `daily-<package>.txt`) is a test moved out of
`verify` into the daily run with `#[ignore = "daily"]` (tools/ci/move_to_daily.py): not a known failure, it must
pass, and its row must name a test that still runs. A package's shard runs the daily rows of the targets it
already runs (its library; every target for the packages in INTEGRATION_TESTS); the shard `daily-rows`
(tools/ci/ignored_shards.py; `daily-rows-launcher` for the launcher's) runs every other daily row, one `cargo test -p PACKAGE TARGET -- --ignored --exact
TEST...` per package and target, from the package's own workspace: a launcher row runs from launcher/ against its
own lockfile (`--locked`).

`--needs VARIABLE --one-process-each` runs the tests marked `needs VARIABLE`, each alone in its own process
(`--list` prints those commands instead), and fails unless every run reports exactly one test passed: a
renamed test would otherwise match nothing and pass. Every test runs, then the step fails if any did.
`--daily-tests PACKAGE TARGET` prints the tests one target's daily rows list, one per line (the Windows daily job
runs horizon-mod-package's with `-- --ignored --exact`).
`--report FILE` also writes the run's verdict as JSON for the daily run's summary (tools/ci/daily_summary.py): each
problem's package, test identity, kind, panic location and policy file, the tests that passed, and the runs that
did not complete with why (stopped()). It is written before each run too, naming that run as in progress, so a job
stopped at its time limit still leaves one. It holds only names and numbers this script prints anyway, never test
output.

Every reader refuses a malformed row, a test listed twice, a folder with no rows or with a file other than `*.txt`
and README.md, and a file at the retired single-list path (tools/ci/check_ignored_test_rows.py checks this alone).

Runtime diagnostics expose identities and allowlisted panic categories, never arbitrary assertion
payloads: the prepared data is Mojang's. Compile/list failures expose bounded compiler headings.
