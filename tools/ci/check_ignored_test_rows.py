"""verify-static's guard for tools/ci/ignored-tests/: read every policy file as the ignored-test readers do.

Fails on a malformed row, a test listed in two files, a folder with no rows or with a file other than `*.txt`
and README.md, and a file at the retired single-list path. The shared reader validates both `needs`
and `needs-plain` fixture rows; neither is a known failure. Every `daily` row must name a package of a workspace (the game's or the launcher's) and
one of its test targets, and some leg of the daily run's matrix must run it: its package's shard, or the `daily-rows`
leg (tools/ci/ignored_shards.py), so no moved test runs nowhere. Builds nothing.

Every `#[ignore]`d test that no daily shard runs (rowless_problems) has a row of some mark: `daily`, a known
failure, `needs`, `manual`, ...; otherwise it would run nowhere unseen. In a shard's own targets a rowless
`#[ignore]` is fine: the shard runs it with `--include-ignored`, and it must pass.

The rows and the source agree both ways (read with tools/ci/rust_tests.py): every function marked
`#[ignore = "daily"]` in a workspace package's sources has a daily row of that package whose test path ends in its
name, and every daily row names a function of that name marked so in its package's sources. A source file compiled
into two targets (horizon-client-render's gfx/sunrise_fan.rs, also built by its `sunrise_shader` test) has one
attribute and a row per target; both rows find it. The limit: rows carry no file and the source has no module path
(a `#[path]` or a game area's derived module can place a file anywhere), so the match is by package and function
name. Two marked functions of one name in one package are satisfied by one row naming either; the daily run, which
runs each row by its exact path, still fails a row whose test does not run.
