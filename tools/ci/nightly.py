"""The Nightly, the only build Horizon ships (.github/workflows/nightly-build.yml, docs/release-flow.md "Nightly").

    nightly.py pick [--force]      which commit tonight's nightly builds: GitHub outputs and nightly-notes.md
    nightly.py pick --kind snapshot   a snapshot of NIGHTLY_BASE (default main's head), a commit of main
                                   with the gate green: built alone, published as snapshot-<date>-<short>
    nightly.py rotate              renames the current `nightly` pre-release to nightly-<its date>, frees the tag
    nightly.py prune [--days 7]    deletes the nightly-<date> pre-releases and tags older than that, nothing else
    nightly.py prune-snapshots [--days 7]   deletes the snapshot-<date>-<short> pre-releases older than that, but
                                   the newest; never an sdk-<sha> SDK (snapshots and nightlies reference those)
    nightly.py prune-builds [--days 7]   deletes the nightly/build-<date>-<n> branches older than that, but the
                                   newest and any a published nightly points to (Ludovic, 2026-10-27)
    nightly.py keep-source <sha> <date>  tags the nightly's commit nightly-source/<date>-<short>, for good
    nightly.py sdk-archives        the assets the SDK's packing legs make (tools/prebuilt_game.py gather), one per line
    nightly.py sdk-assets          every asset a complete sdk-<sha> release holds: those, sdk.json and the signed sums
    nightly.py sdk-index <sha> <out>     writes sdk-<sha>'s sdk.json to <out>, checked against its SHA256SUMS
    nightly.py sdk-previous <sha> <out>  prints the SDK published before <sha> on its history, and writes its
                                   surface.json to <out>, checked; prints nothing when there is none

A nightly builds main plus the pull requests the trusted reviewers picked (the set: tools/ci/nightly_set.py), merged
in their order and pushed as nightly/build-<date>-<n>; with no set, main alone. Main is its newest commit where
this repository's checks passed (`dyna-checks` on the fork, `checks` and `parity-main` upstream), as for a release
(release_train.green_main_head), or NIGHTLY_BASE when the caller gives that commit. It is published as the
`nightly` pre-release; the previous one stays a week as nightly-<date>.
On arismoko/horizon only, the base is the commit `daily-green` points to (the newest daily run that passed every
leg, which also published its SDK: release_train.daily_green_commit), with a complete published `sdk-<sha>` release
of the current package format for that exact SHA, whose sdk.json the Nightly carries in its signed sums. An explicit base that is any other commit, or has no SDK, fails; PR picks are
disabled, and the final SHA is rechecked before pushing.
Its notes list what reached main since the previous nightly, then the picked pull requests. Runs from main's
checkout with `gh`; it reads and merges the branches with git and never runs anything from them.

Each nightly ships its exact source: horizon-source.tar.gz (`git archive` of the commit, signed with the builds) on
the release, and the tag nightly-source/<date>-<short>, which no prune deletes. Native mods pin a nightly's commit
(docs/native-mods.md), so that commit must stay downloadable after its release and build branch are gone.
