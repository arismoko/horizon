"""mdBook preprocessor: the mod SDK reference's tables, rendered from what the code publishes, never kept by hand.

- `{{#sdk-assets}}`: the files of an `sdk-<build id>` release, from the list the publish job refuses to release
  without (`tools/ci/nightly.py`, `SDK_ASSETS`).
- `{{#sdk-routes}}`: which compiled slices each launcher route fetches, from the SDK's input list
  (`crates/horizon-mod-package/src/sdk/inputs.json`).
- `{{#sdk-hosts}}`: the computers an SDK is built for, from the packing legs (`nightly.py`, `SDK_LEGS`).
- `{{#sdk-surface}}`: the record kinds of `surface.json`, each with its id form and how many this commit has, from
  this checkout's own export (`horizon-stage surface`).

The words beside each kind, target, route and record prefix are here; a name that has none fails the build, and so
do words for one that is gone, so the tables never drift from what is published. A marker no chapter holds fails the
build too, so a table cannot drop out of the book unnoticed.
