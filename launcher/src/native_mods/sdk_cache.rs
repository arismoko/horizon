//! The mod SDK of one game build, as the launcher fetches and keeps it (SDK design §1, §3, §4,
//! §14): its signed index, `sdk.json`, first; then only the slices the instance's route needs,
//! each unpacked into a folder of its own by [`sdk::unpack`] and used again after a cheap stamp
//! check; and the small files the fit test and planning read (`surface.json`, `build-data`).
//!
//! Where it comes from: `<base>/sdk-<build id>/<file>`, the base being this repository's release
//! downloads, or `HORIZON_SDK_BASE` ([`BASE_VAR`]): a URL (a mirror) or a folder (a copy for
//! offline use). Every base is checked the same way: `SHA256SUMS` signed by a release key for the
//! tag `sdk-<build id>`, `sdk.json`'s SHA-256 in it, then each file's size and SHA-256 in
//! `sdk.json`. A game release carries a copy of its SDK's `sdk.json` under the same signature
//! scheme, and that copy is where the game's build id comes from ([`build_of`]).
//!
//! What is kept, under the launcher's native build folder:
//! - `sdk/<build id>/`: `sdk.json` (as verified), `surface.json`, `build-data/`; a few MB, kept,
//!   so a mod's fit is told without a download once a build was seen.
//! - `sdk/versions/<game version>`: the build id that version's release named.
//! - `prebuilt/<build id>-<target>[-server]/`: the compiled slices (`runtime/`, `api/`,
//!   `engine/`), each with `<slice>.stamp` beside it, written while the build lease is held; the
//!   folder is one storage unit, evicted whole with what an unpack left in it (`.partial`,
//!   `.lock`, a download).
