# Writing the modding book

The modding book (`docs/modding`, published at <https://arismoko.github.io/horizon/>) is the manual for mod
authors: it describes what the game does on main, nothing else. Designs, proposals, plans, trackers and coverage
ledgers live in [`docs/design/`](design/) (mod API designs in [`docs/design/mod-api/`](design/mod-api/)), and
notes for people working on Horizon itself in [`docs/mod-api/`](mod-api/). The book build refuses a page whose
title reads as a design, a plan or a work list.

## Where each doc lives

The book follows [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr): a page is one of four kinds, and does only that job.

| Kind | Job | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Tutorial | Take a newcomer to a working result | Getting started (`start/`) |
| Explanation | Say how the pieces fit, with no steps | Concepts (`concepts/`) |
| How-to | One task, steps only | How-to (`how-to/`), grouped by what the mod changes |
| Reference | Facts, complete and dry | Reference (`reference/`), and the rustdoc of `horizon-mod-api` |

- **A hook, event or `Host` method:** its `///` lines in the declaration under `crates/horizon-mod-vocab/src/hooks/`.
  The generator writes it as `///` on the generated item; `cargo doc -p horizon-mod-api` shows it. A hook without
  a `doc` fails the build.
- **A hook whose game target has many parameters:** a `native_*` target takes at most 7 parameters (receiver included;
  `MAX_TARGET_PARAMETERS` in `crates/horizon-mod-api-gen/src/dispatch.rs`). A hook with more declares its parameters
  on the hook (`fn update_shape(dimension: LevelDimension, ...);`, as written in `hooks/*.rs`) and the target takes them
  as one generated `<Name>Call` (`native_update_shape(&self, ticks, call: UpdateShapeCall<'_>)`),
  handed to `dispatch_<name>(host, call)`. The generator refuses a flat target over the limit, and a target never carries
  `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]`. The hooks that were already over the limit are listed in
  `FLAT_TARGETS_OVER_THE_LIMIT` in the same file; that list only shrinks (convert a hook, delete its line) and a new hook
  is never added to it. The carrier is host-internal plain data, never on wasm, and no modder sees it.
- **Hook notes:** keep longer prose in a `#[notes = r#"..."#]` attribute on its hook or helper declaration,
  heading included. General catalog prose lives in `hooks/notes.rs`. `mdbook build docs/modding` renders
  the Hook notes chapter from those attributes without writing a Markdown source page. To preview just
  that chapter, run `cargo run --quiet -p xtask -- mod-api notes`; do not commit its output.
- **A guide page:** `docs/modding/src/`. Code in a page is `{{#include}}`d from `docs/modding/examples`, which
  compiles, so a change to the API that breaks an example fails the build.
- **A mod API change** updates its fragment `doc` and any page it affects in the same PR.
- **A new page:** add the file to the folder of its topic. A page `X.md` with a folder `X/` beside it gets the
  folder's pages as its sub-chapters, in file name order (a numeric prefix such as `07-` sets the order where it
  matters), titled by each page's `#` heading; `<!-- section-pages -->` in `X.md` becomes a list of them. A page
  directly in `concepts/` or `how-to/` that `SUMMARY.md` doesn't list joins the end of its part, by title. Any
  other new page needs its `SUMMARY.md` line: the build fails on a page the book doesn't render, and on a
  `SUMMARY.md` link to a missing file.
- **Links:** relative between book pages (inline or reference-style; root-relative links are refused), and
  a github.com URL for anything else in the repository, since the site publishes only `docs/modding/src`. The
  build checks every link and anchor.
- **Images:** SVG under `docs/modding/src/images/`, with alt text that says what the picture says. Text sits on its
  own filled box so a figure reads on the light and the dark themes alike.
- `src/llms.txt` is the index for agents; keep it in step with `SUMMARY.md`.

Build the book with `mdbook build docs/modding` and the reference with `cargo doc -p horizon-mod-api --no-deps`.

## How the book reads

The book is the manual a mod author reads: it says what the game does, and how to use it.

- **Present tense, second person.** "The hook fires after…", "You declare…". Imperative for steps.
- **No status words** (provisional, not built yet, planned, for now, today, currently, as of, still, no longer,
  first slice, follow-up). A feature that does not exist is not mentioned. A request the game refuses is
  documented as behaviour: what is refused, when, and the message or error the author sees.
- **No history:** no "used to", "replaces the old…", migration notes or comparisons with an earlier Horizon.
  Naming the NeoForge or vanilla counterpart of a concept is welcome.
- **No issue or PR numbers, dates, commit hashes, rulings, review notes, test names or benchmark logs,** and no
  instructions for people changing Horizon itself: those go in `docs/mod-api/`.
- **Short.** Lead with what the reader can do and one example; then rules and limits as a list or table.
- **Names exactly as in code,** in backticks. When the code and a page disagree, the code wins: fix the page.
- **Code samples** are `{{#include}}`d from `docs/modding/examples`, which compiles. An inline sample that is not
  compiled is fenced `rust,ignore` and still matches the real signatures.

## What a PR needs to show

Code review, CI and your own focused tests are the proof. You don't need to run the game.

A reviewer runs your change in game at your head only when a test can't cover one of these, and says which:

- rendering or UI, what the player sees;
- client-server sync: LAN guests, a dedicated server, packets;
- when or in what order something happens compared with vanilla, such as a hook's firing point.

If your PR changes or removes something mods already use, the reviewer also runs
[horizon-machine-sample](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon-machine-sample) against it. A new item's `///` doc is its
reference.

## A catalog point and the wasm fixture

A new or changed catalog point is proven by the wasm fixture: real wasm mods (`crates/horizon-mod-wasm/tests/fixture`,
`library-fixture` and `groups`) built with `cargo horizon-mod build --wasm` and loaded by the real loader. The
`wasm-mods` CI job does all of it on pushes to main and on manual dispatch; it does not run on pull requests. Main
pushes coalesce: a started run finishes and only the newest waiting push runs next, so the newest finished main run
proves every commit before it. A red is attributed by reading the error, with a manual dispatch on a suspect commit
(through a branch pointing at it) when needed. A maintainer dispatches it on a PR branch that changes what it builds. That job is the answer; you don't
need a local build.

To run it yourself, on Linux or Windows, follow the steps of `.github/workflows/wasm-mods.yml` from the repository
root; the tool installs its pinned toolchain through rustup. One wasm compile of `horizon-mod-points` takes about
10 GiB of memory, so set `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1` on a 16 GiB machine. To check one change, build only the member that
uses the point and run its test. The build rewrites files in the fixture folders; don't commit them.
