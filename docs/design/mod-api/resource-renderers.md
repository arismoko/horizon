# Design: resource-backed special item renderers

Provisional answer to [#876](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/876):
what resource-backed baked geometry and typed stack-derived state may a special
renderer submit? Geometry belongs in resources; callbacks select and pose baked
parts only where ordinary item-model properties cannot express the behavior.

## Settled on the build

The owner's answer to the [build plan](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/876#issuecomment-6864610602)
settles these points against the reference. Where a later section of this page
says otherwise, this section wins; "ours" marks what Horizon adds.

- **Registration.** `register_special_model_renderer` (singular, after the
  reference's event) is asked once per process at start, before the first
  resource load, never on a reload; every resource load resolves it into the
  table. Stage 1 ([how-to](../../modding/src/how-to/client/special-item-renderers.md))
  implements it.
- **Duplicates.** A later registration of an id replaces the earlier one,
  vanilla ids included, as the reference does. Ours: one log line names both
  registrants. Nothing is refused for being a duplicate or a vanilla id.
- **An unknown type id.** Only that item's model fails: an error log naming the
  id and the item, the item draws the missing model, the rest of the reload goes
  on, and the item's previous model is not kept. "A failed reload keeps the
  previous holder" applies only to a whole-reload failure of ours.
- **Data.** The renderer reads what it needs from the whole stack; nothing
  declares inputs, and no cap applies to the stack beyond the reference's.
  Extraction is cached by the stack's equality, so an unchanged stack is
  extracted once across frames and nothing is copied per frame for it.
- **`base`** supplies only render properties (lighting, particle, display
  transforms), which the engine applies; the renderer never sees them.
- **Extents.** None: the reference doesn't check declared extents or cull by
  them, so the API has none and the engine takes none from the mod. It takes the
  drawn parts' own quads.
- **Threads.** The node's `config` decodes, and models bake, on the reload's
  worker threads; extraction and drawing run on the client's main thread.
- **Failures.** The reference doesn't catch a throw. Ours is stricter in the safe
  direction: a renderer that errors, panics or traps is refused with one log line
  naming the id, and the item draws the missing model; a decode or bake failure
  loses only that item. The callback gets a `ClientHost` (every hook gets a host).
- **Out of scope.** The block side is a separate reference registration that runs
  on every reload, not part of #876.
- **Matrix rows 5 and 7** each need their own test; a test that the callback never
  runs inside a lifted pass shows row 6 only.

## Reference and boundary

Vanilla 26.3 `SpecialModelRenderers.bootstrap` registers type identifiers and
unbaked codecs. `SpecialModelWrapper.update` extracts an argument from the stack,
creates a layer, records extents, transform and foil, and installs the special
renderer plus argument. Verified using `tools/rea_vanilla.py method` for both
methods from `/workspace/horizon`. The `callers` query for the wrapper's `update`
returned zero direct references; interface dispatch means that is not a complete
context census. Horizon routes are listed below instead.

The named NeoForge counterpart is `RegisterSpecialModelRendererEvent`. Its
[26.3 public Javadoc](https://aldak.netlify.app/javadoc/26.3.x/net/neoforged/neoforge/client/event/RegisterSpecialModelRendererEvent.html)
was inaccessible during this investigation. Public [client-item documentation](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/resources/client/models/items/)
describes stack state preparation and submission, but currently labels itself
26.1. Exact 26.3 registration timing, cancellation, codec shape and capability
limits remain **unverified**. Require public 26.3 documentation before adopting
those details; the contract below is proposed Horizon policy, not asserted parity.
No foreign renderer source was read.

`level-extracted-state.md` is absent from `arismoko/main` at this worktree's base
`ff35cdee95`. [PR #2357](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/pull/2357) is an
adjacent proposal only; this design neither copies it nor requires its contents.

## Proposed registration, bake and preparation

One `register_special_model_renderer` client registration moment takes a
`ClientHost` and a typed registrar. Dependency-ordered listeners register a
namespaced type and one preparation callback, which reads the whole stack. A later registration of a type replaces the earlier one
and the log names both owners; vanilla built-in identifiers can be replaced. Resolve
identifiers and callback slots at load/bake, not on every draw. No second event
bus or compatibility alias is introduced.

API-owned `SpecialRendererRegistrationWire`, `SpecialResourceSchemaWire`,
`SpecialBakeRecipeWire`, `SpecialStackInputWire`, `SpecialDrawContextWire`,
`SpecialDrawListWire` and `SpecialPartInstanceWire` define explicit integer
widths, enum tags and lengths. Generated native and wasm adapters share these
representations and validation; game JSON values, Rust engine structs, GPU
pointers and borrowed live stacks never cross the boundary. Wire is an API
boundary, not a network synchronization format.

Resources declare named geometry parts, texture/material references, local
transforms. Reuse existing model loading/baking and
prepared geometry ownership. Bake once per resource reload; callbacks cannot
create geometry, compile shaders, read arbitrary files or recursively render
items. `UnsupportedSpecialRendererCapability` refuses registration requesting
raw pipelines, live world access, arbitrary codecs or recursive item draws. Unknown special types produce
`UnknownSpecialRendererType` with resource path and type, replacing the foreign
base-model workaround. This refusal applies only to special-model type decoding;
unrelated unknown identifiers keep their existing behavior. Built-in specials
retain their existing renderer paths. A failed candidate resource reload leaves
the previous complete resource set active; initial failure uses the ordinary
missing-model diagnostic rather than silently drawing `base`.

Client-lib decides preparation input; game fires the registered callback with
`ClientHost` and a typed drawing context; client-lib validates and applies in one
transaction. Input is an immutable copy of declared component values, display
context, owner snapshot, deterministic seed, pose, packed light and foil policy.
The drawing context records instances of this recipe's baked parts with local
poses and vanilla-space tint. It exposes no device, frame format or live entity.
The output is an immutable draw list stored in the ordinary item render state;
GUI and world consumers execute it without calling the mod again. Engine display
transforms, clipping, lighting, glint, sorting and bounds remain authoritative.
Bounds come from the drawn parts' own quads; the mod declares none.

Apply rechecks the captured stack revision, resource holder and mod lifetime;
changed preconditions refuse the prepared result, never recompute within apply.
A later ordinary preparation may retry. Preparation writes and staged draws roll
back together. Inside lifted passes, publication, retirement and journal emission
wait for root commit; rollback publishes nothing. Saves are refused during an
open action savepoint under the existing transaction rule, even though rendering
itself adds no persistent state.

## Lifetime and colour

Use the existing resource lifecycle holder and its identity for baked references
and leases, with resolved part slots. Do not add a special-renderer generation
counter. Reload builds a complete candidate, validates/bakes it, then publishes
atomically at root commit. Old queued states hold leases until submission ends;
they cannot publish into the replacement holder. Retire resources after leases
drain. Unload stops new callbacks, drains outstanding callback/draw leases, then
unloads native code or wasm stores. Device recreation rebuilds engine GPU objects
from resource data without exposing their identity to mods.

Follow [mod render colour](mod-render-colour.md). Packed ARGB tint and light
0..=15 remain vanilla-space inputs, converted once by the engine. Shader colours
are linear BT.709, paper white 1.0, values above 1 allowed. Generated entry/exit
boundaries own storage conversion. Texture data channels stay data; coverage does
not grant ownership of frame alpha. Shader-pack and SDR/HDR changes preserve this
contract and cannot make a callback depend on the frame format.

## Current route owners

Verified against base `ff35cdee95`; paths are relative to `crates/`. These are
integration owners, not claims that the proposed callback already exists.

| Resource parts and baked extents | `horizon-client/src/item_render/special.rs:51`, `:307`; `horizon-client/src/item_render.rs:748`, `:841` | Bake resource recipe and conservative bounds |
| Shared stack preparation, hands | `horizon-client/src/game/interface/item_draw.rs:376`, `:398` | Freeze declared inputs and prepare once per resolution |
| Inventory, cursor and other GUI icons | `horizon-client/src/game/interface/inventory_slots.rs:6`; `horizon-client/src/game/interface/item_draw.rs:455`; `horizon-client/src/item_render/gui.rs:180` | Same prepared parts, GUI clipping and lighting |

| Reload and GPU resource ownership | `horizon-client/src/game.rs:14259`; `horizon-client-render/src/gfx/prepared_model.rs:256` | Rebuild affected item states and retain leased resources |

Native and wasm need generated catalog registration, dispatch and callback exports
in the eventual implementation; neither adapter exists for this feature today.
Both must enter the same game preparation boundary and enforce identical failures.
The implementation review must trace first/third-person callers through the
shared hand resolver and reload publication through its full owner chain before
claiming exhaustive integration.

## Untrusted inputs and cost

Proposed extension budgets: 256 parts per recipe, 65536 vertices per part,
16 MiB decoded geometry per recipe, 64 KiB resource parameters, 256 instances and 64 KiB encoded draw output per preparation.
Use checked arithmetic before allocation; bound encoded and decoded sizes,
resource nesting to 32 and identifiers to 256 UTF-8 bytes. Reject invalid tags,
indices, foreign/stale part slots and dependency cycles. Transforms must be
finite; their size is not capped. These extension budgets do not cap vanilla's own
models, stack components or draw capacity, and the stack itself has no cap beyond
the reference's.

Catch unwind-capable native callback panics; wasm traps and fuel exhaustion have
the same policy: discard the entire draw list and callback transaction, diagnose
once and disable the registration for the holder lifetime. Draw the missing-model
marker for affected custom layers, retaining independent built-in layers. A later
built-in item still renders normally. Native aborts cannot be caught and native
callbacks cannot safely be forcibly preempted; wasm gets finite execution fuel.
Reject an invalid command atomically, never retain a partially accepted list.

With no registrations, retain the existing built-in branch: one O(1) resolved
variant test, zero extension allocations, serialization or listener scans. A
registered draw dispatches directly by resolved slot, copies only declared inputs
and records bounded commands. GPU/CPU submission has no callback or mod scan.
These are performance acceptance requirements, not measured results.

## Acceptance matrix

Future implementation tests use original assets, not third-party model files.

| Case | Concrete expected result |
| --- | --- |
| Original cube A and two separated cubes B; boolean component false/true | Exactly 6/12 resource quads selected in both inventory and hand |
| Same true stack in ground, frame, head and other-player hand | B selected in all four; engine context transforms differ |
| Resource reload changes B to three cubes | True stack selects 18 quads after commit; 0 new draws reference old holder |
| Reload fails with unknown special type | Named error; previous holder remains active; initial load displays missing model |
| Queue old state, reload, drain | Old lease valid until drain; retirement occurs once after root commit |
| Rollback lifted preparation/reload | 0 published draws, retirements or journal entries |
| Save during action savepoint | Refused; no persisted partial state |
| NaN transform, 257 instances, stale part, oversized input | Entire custom layer refused; 0 partial instances |
| Native panic / wasm trap followed by vanilla cube | Custom layer missing marker; vanilla cube still 6 quads |
| Unsupported raw-pipeline capability / duplicate registration | Named registration refusal; no partial type installation |
| White 1, linear RGB 2, encoded tint 0.5 | Shader values 1, 2, approximately 0.21763764; frame alpha engine-owned |
| Native and wasm, same inputs | Identical part slots, transforms, tint and refusal outcomes |
| No listener, repeated built-in scenes | Identical baseline output; 0 extension callbacks/allocations |

## Proposed stages (file none)

1. Review this contract and obtain public NeoForge 26.3 registration evidence.
2. Finalize API-owned Wire schemas, generated native/wasm boundary and refusal
   diagnostics; connect resource decode/bake to existing lifecycle ownership.
3. Integrate shared stack preparation and both submission paths, transactional
   reload/teardown and colour rules; trace all caller routes above.
4. Add original-asset acceptance scenes, failure injection and empty-registration
   counters, then measure cost. No implementation files are proposed in this note.

## Open questions

- Exact NeoForge 26.3 registration contract is unverified. Recommendation: require
  public 26.3 docs/Javadoc before locking the counterpart's signature and timing;
  do not infer it from older docs or source.
- R2 prepared-part API and practical extension budgets need implementation review.
  Recommendation: use the existing lifecycle holder with the budgets above,
  test representative original scenes, and enlarge only extension limits with
  measured evidence; preserve vanilla capacity throughout.

Renderer answers depend only on stack and configuration. Host-state changes do not invalidate a continuously drawn unchanged stack. Answers drop after all views stop drawing the stack or resources reload.
