# Transactions

Use `HostTransaction` on a `ServerHost` to group capability writes. The closure's
`Ok` commits; `Err` aborts. Pass the borrowed `&Transaction` to each handler or
place write.

```rust,ignore
use mod_api::{HostTransaction, ServerHost};

fn update(host: &mut dyn ServerHost) -> Result<(), ()> {
    host.transaction(|host, tx| {
        // Pass host and tx to your capability writes.
        Ok(())
    })
}
```

## Commit and rollback

- Writes apply immediately, so subsequent steps in the transaction see them.
- The game snapshots each storage before its first write. Handlers use the game's
  journal rather than keeping their own.
- A nested commit merges into its parent. Only the outermost commit makes changes
  final and publishes their notifications.
- An abort restores the recorded storage without publishing commit effects.
- A panic unwinding out of the closure aborts its transaction. The parent remains
  open if you catch the panic inside the parent closure.
- Closing a transaction aborts any transactions left open inside it before closing
  the parent.

The journal covers writes through capability handlers to these storages:

| Storage | Recorded state |
|---|---|
| Block entity | Item slots, saved compound, custom name and attachments |
| Hopper | Cooldown |
| Cauldron | Block state |
| Composter | Block state and composter-local random stream; fill feedback, game events and maturation scheduling wait for outer commit |
| World fluid pickup and placement | Block state, and a block entity the new block removes |
| Player | Inventory slots, armour, offhand and cursor, for host and guest players |
| Entity inventory | Chest or hopper minecart, chest boat, chested donkey, mule or llama inventory |
| Item entity | Stack; an emptied entity remains until the outermost commit removes it |

At the outermost commit, the game publishes change notifications and deferred
effects: `setChanged`, comparators, jukebox playback, cauldron and composter block updates and
item drops. Drops include items placed at a block, thrown by a player or entity,
or split off an item entity.

A world pickup or placement of fluid (`level.pickup_fluid`, `level.place_fluid`) writes
its block at the call and the rest at the outermost commit; an aborted one leaves the world
unchanged, where NeoForge's may not. `level.play_fluid_effects` queues a fluid's sound and
game event the same way: they play only at the outermost commit and are dropped on abort,
unlike `trigger_sound_and_game_event`, which acts at once. The `block_drops` listeners of a
replaced block see it as it was, and a cancelled drop keeps the replacement.

Direct writes are not journaled: direct item-entity stack writes,
`LivingRef::set_equipment`, and the player and armor-stand `slot_set` paths take
effect immediately, even inside a transaction. Equipment sounds and equip/unequip
events from `LivingRef::set_equipment` also happen immediately. An abort does not
undo these writes or effects. Use journaled capability handlers when you need rollback.

## Transaction authority

`Transaction` identifies an open transaction with a game-issued write token. It
does not grant permission to close it. A write with a token that does not name an
open transaction changes nothing, including a token retained past its closure.

Closing requires a separate `TransactionSeal`. The `host.transaction` guard holds
that seal; its closure receives only the write token. If you use the raw
`transaction_open` method, you receive the seal and must close it with
`transaction_close`. The game refuses a seal that does not match an open
transaction and logs `Horizon: refused to close a transaction the seal does not end`.

## Inspecting a transaction

These methods are server-only:

| Method | Result |
|---|---|
| `host.transaction_current()` | Innermost open `Transaction`, or `None`; not a closing seal |
| `host.transaction_depth(tx)` | `Some(0)` for the outermost transaction, increasing by one per nesting level; `None` if it is not open |
| `host.transaction_lifecycle()` | `TransactionLifecycle` describing the open or closing phase |

| `TransactionLifecycle` variant | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `None` | No transaction is open |
| `Open` | A transaction is open and none is closing |
| `Closing` | A nested transaction is committing into its parent or aborting |
| `RootClosing` | The outermost transaction is closing |

On a root commit, `contents_changed` listeners run during `RootClosing`. Their
writes are outside the transaction whose commit triggered them.

## Entity inventory slots

`ItemPlace::EntitySlot { entity, slot }` addresses an entity inventory slot, like
NeoForge's `Capabilities.Item.ENTITY`. Read and write it like any other item place.
Reading or writing a minecart's slots unpacks its loot table without a player,
as vanilla's `getChestVehicleItem` does.
