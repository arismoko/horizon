# Block fluids

Look up `level.capability(host, &FLUIDS, pos, side)` to access a block's
`ResourceHandler<FluidResource>`. Transfer fluids inside a transaction with
`move_resources`, as you transfer items. `FLUIDS` corresponds to NeoForge's
`Capabilities.Fluid.BLOCK`. Amounts are millibuckets (mB); one bucket is 1000 mB.

## Resources and tanks

`FluidResource` identifies a fluid and its data components without an amount.
Use `resource.to_stack(amount)` to create a `FluidStack`, and
`FluidResource::of(&stack)` to obtain its resource identity. A tank accepts fluid
when empty or when its contents match both the fluid and components.

| Game provider | Rules |
| --- | --- |
| Mod block tanks (`r.block_fluids(&block, tanks)` with `ModFluidTanks`) | Access depends on side. Saved tanks reject fluids with components. |
| Water cauldron | One bucket in three levels; insertion and extraction use whole levels. |
| Lava cauldron | One bucket, inserted or extracted whole. |
| Registered cauldron content | Uses the whole levels specified through `register_cauldron_fluid_content`. |
| Powder snow cauldron | No fluid handler. |

Cauldrons are position-based providers, not block entities. They accept registered
fluids regardless of components and discard those components; extracted fluid is
plain. An empty cauldron accepts any fluid with registered cauldron content.

If a destination accepts only part of a transfer, `move_resources` rolls back and
retries with that amount. A full water cauldron asked for a bucket when the
destination has room for 500 mB supplies one level, 334 mB, without overanswering.

## Cauldron contents

To inspect a cauldron without probing its capability, use the `fluids` host reads
`host.cauldron_content_for_block(block_key)` and `host.cauldron_content_for_fluid(fluid_key)`.
Both return `Option<CauldronContent>`: typed `block` and `fluid` keys, full `total` in
millibuckets, `max_level`, and optional `level_property`. Water answers 1000, 3, and
`Some("level")`; lava answers 1000, 1, and `None`. `host.cauldron_level(state)` reads a
typed state's current level (water at level 2 answers 2); an always-full content
answers its maximum. Unregistered contents, including powder snow, answer `None`.
These `WorldOnly` reads work on both sides, over the existing registration table,
including mods and rebuilt resource generations. A client that has not built that table
answers `None`. Native and wasm consumers receive the same plain values; there is no
work unless called. A content lookup scans the existing content table without a mod
scan, clones its shared snapshot, and allocates only the returned level-property string
when present; the scalar level read allocates no result.

## Item containers

Use `place.capability(host, &ITEM_FLUIDS)` for the fluid handler at an `ItemPlace`.
Register a provider with `r.item_capability(&ITEM_FLUIDS, "mymod:canister", …)`.
Changes exchange one item, splitting the changed item from a larger stack.

Vanilla buckets expose one 1000 mB tank. Empty buckets accept plain water or lava
and become filled buckets; filled buckets drain whole and become empty buckets.
`move_resources` transfers between item and block handlers: a full cauldron can
fill a bucket in a player slot, but a cauldron holding two levels cannot.

## Player interaction

Call `fluid_util::interact_with_fluid_handler(host, player, hand, level, pos, side)`
from your block's `use_item_on` part, and return success when it returns `true`.
This corresponds to NeoForge's `FluidUtil.interactWithFluidHandler`.

The helper looks up the block's `FLUIDS` and the held item's `ITEM_FLUIDS` through
`ItemPlace::PlayerHand`. It first tries filling the item, then emptying it if no
fluid moves. It transfers the first fluid that can move, as much as fits in one
operation. From three buckets, it fills and splits off one; a creative player's
hand stack is unchanged.

After a successful transfer, the helper emits the sound and game event at the
block's centre:

| Operation | Game event | Fluid sound |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fill the item | `minecraft:fluid_pickup` | `fluid_pickup_sound` |
| Empty the item | `minecraft:fluid_place` | `fluid_empty_sound` |

A tank-only fluid emits the event without a sound.
`fluid_util::interact_with_handler` performs the interaction against a handler you
supply. `fluid_util::trigger_sound_and_game_event` emits only the sound and event.
These effects are emitted before the call returns: call these helpers outside
an enclosing transaction that you might abort.

## World fluid

A fluid container can pick up and place fluid in the world as a bucket does
(NeoForge's `FluidUtil.tryPickupFluid` and `tryPlaceFluid`):

| Helper | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `fluid_util::try_pickup_world_fluid(host, destination, player, level, pos)` | Takes the source at `pos` (a fluid source, a waterlogged block's water, a bubble column) into `destination`, the whole bucket or nothing |
| `fluid_util::try_pickup_fluid(host, destination, player, level, pos, side)` | The same, and where `pos` has no source, one move from the block's `FLUIDS` at `side` |
| `fluid_util::try_place_fluid(host, source, player, level, pos, validate)` | Takes a bucket of the first fluid of `source` that comes out whole and places it at `pos`; `validate` refuses a waterloggable block that won't take it |
| `fluid_util::first_stack_contained(host, place)` | Reads what the container at an `ItemPlace` holds at its first non-empty index |

The three that move fluid each run in a transaction of its own, nested in one you have
open. Under them, `level.pickup_fluid(host, pos, player, tx)` and
`level.place_fluid(host, pos, fluid, player, validate, tx)` decide everything at the
call against the world as the transaction has it and write the block at once, so a
second pickup of the same source in the transaction gets nothing. A block the fluid
replaces has its drops made at the call, with the block as it is and its block entity kept
by the journal first: `block_drops` listeners, which only read, see the old block, and a
cancelled drop keeps the replacement (it suppresses the drops and the experience, not the
removal). The new block is written after the drops are made.
The block's updates, the fluid tick, those drops, the broken block's particles and
`block_destroy`, then the bucket's sound and `fluid_pickup` or `fluid_place` follow at the
outermost commit. Where water evaporates (the Nether), placing it only hisses. The tank
fallback's fill sound and event also wait for that commit
(`level.play_fluid_effects(host, pos, fluid, pickup, player, tx)`). An aborted pickup or
placement leaves the world unchanged, with no drop, sound or event, where NeoForge's may
leave it changed.
