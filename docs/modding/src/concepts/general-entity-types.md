# Design: general entity types

Provisional answer to [#792](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/792): register a type once, store each instance in a game-owned general entity row, and dispatch its catalog-generated EntityPart behavior through a resolved type slot. The row owns identity, residency, persistence and tracking. It must never create a throwable or other template entity. This is a proposal for Ari's decision on the issue, not implemented API or a closure claim.

## Implemented stage 2 API

`Hooks::register` receives `&mut dyn Registrar`, whose `GeneralTypesRegistrar`
supertrait provides `declare_general_entity(path, category, width, height,
save_policy, summonable, tracking_chunks, update_interval, payload_version,
required_features)`. Use `GeneralEntityCategory::Misc` and
`GeneralSavePolicy::{Save, NoSave}`. The path must belong to the declaring
mod's namespace. Registration is only available during the registration phase,
requires a both-side package, and refuses duplicates and unavailable required
mods with `GeneralEntityRegistrationError` while recording a refusal.

Dimensions must be finite. Tracking distance and interval use signed `i32`
values directly, matching the vanilla builder; `i32::MAX` means no update
interval. There is no 64-block, 32-chunk or 1200-tick ceiling.

The engine freezes declarations in mod-id/type-id order into non-narrowed
catalog indices. Stage 2 supplies record validation and a `Kind::General` row
with residency lookup, not live entity admission. It does not yet enable
spawning, saving/loading, tracking, rendering, or entity tick dispatch. The
record validator preserves the general-record policies of 65,536 payload
bytes and passenger depth 16; decoded payload nesting 32 belongs to stage 3.
Unknown types are reported separately after structural validation; byte-preserving
quarantine is future work, not an implemented save guarantee.

The remaining sections describe the wider design, not shipped lifecycle support.

## Evidence and limits

Vanilla 26.3 was queried from `/workspace/horizon` with `python3 tools/rea_vanilla.py`: `method net.minecraft.server.level.ServerLevel tickNonPassenger` runs commonTick, tick, then passenger ticking. `--overload-index 0 method net.minecraft.world.entity.EntityType loadEntityRecursive` delegates compound input through registry-aware TagValueInput and a problem reporter; this wrapper alone does not establish unknown-type recovery. `callers net.minecraft.server.level.ServerLevel addFreshEntity` reports 36 callers, including dispenser vehicles, loot drops, TNT, hatching and dragon creation. Creation is consequently wider than summon. Exact recursive-load internals, passenger tick semantics and global vanilla iteration ordering remain unverified; do not infer them from these queries.

The issue names NeoForge 26.3 RegisterEvent and Registries.ENTITY_TYPE. The permitted [entity guide](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/entities/) describes registered singleton types, instance behavior, separate renderers, server insertion and configurable tracking. It is explicitly labelled **26.1**, not 26.3. The [26.3 RegisterEvent Javadoc](https://aldak.netlify.app/javadoc/26.3.x/net/neoforged/neoforge/registries/RegisterEvent.html) was inaccessible through the web reader. Exact NeoForge 26.3 registration, lifecycle ordering, persistence and tracking contracts are **unverified**. No NeoForge source, patches or other project's implementation was read. The following is an explicit Horizon proposal, not asserted NeoForge equivalence.

## Registration and ownership

Freeze a namespaced entity-type registry before worlds or connections open. A declaration supplies category, finite dimensions, save/summon policy, signed integer tracking distance and update interval, codec schema and required client features. Reject duplicate keys, unresolved required dependencies and invalid limits at registration. Resolve registry keys to compact slots, behavior subscribers and codecs once. Content declarations and code declarations use one registry, with no reserved throwable fallback or compatibility alias.

Use one dense general-entity store per level, with constant-time identity-to-slot lookup and generation validation; removal may swap rows while updating the index. A row contains type slot, UUID, runtime network id, incarnation/join identity, dimension, pose, velocity, lifecycle flags and attachment holder. Never persist runtime slots, network ids or pointers. EntityRef validates world epoch, dimension and incarnation before exposing a row. Reusing id 42 cannot make an old handle address its replacement. UUID continuity on reload does not revive an old live handle.

EntityPart is shared behavior, not mutable per-instance storage. Follow [PR #2328](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/pull/2328), the provisional #796 state design: existing attachments are the sole Part-data store, with typed authoring erased at registration, snapshot reads and checked transactional edits. Do not introduce a parallel entity data map. #779 supplies entity scope and scoped moments; it does not by itself supply entity ownership. Generate new methods only for named verified moments, with ServerHost or ClientHost and the existing dependency dispatch order. No Game references escape.

## Tick and residency

At the authoritative entity phase, walk eligible general rows once in stable join order, with an indexed iteration schedule maintained on mutation rather than sorting each tick. For each root run common bookkeeping, its subscribed server behavior, then its passenger subtree. A passenger is not also ticked as a root. Newly committed spawns first tick next phase; a row removed before its turn receives no tick. Buffer structural edits until safe boundaries. Revalidate deferred operations after listener writes and refuse stale decisions without recomputing.

Join ordering and next-phase spawn visibility are proposed Horizon choices pending vanilla oracle comparison. They must not reorder existing vanilla families incidentally. Client interpolation/render updates never execute authoritative behavior.

Use #1606's residency journal and visibility boundary for insert, lift, restore, move and retirement. Unloaded or parked entities persist but do not tick; ordinary entities do not acquire chunk tickets merely by existing. Temporary lift is not removal and cannot retire attachments or emit a tracking despawn. Commit publishes changes once; abort restores the original join identity, row and attachments. Save refuses while a lifted pass or entity transaction is open. Dimension transfer preserves UUID and data, invalidates source-scoped handles, removes source tracking and creates destination tracking atomically. World close invalidates its epoch.

## Save, load and missing mods

Save common fields plus namespaced type key, payload schema version and bounded attachment payloads to the existing entity-region owner. Serialize committed snapshots only. Load validates sizes, nesting, UUID uniqueness, passenger cycles and coordinates before insertion; decode and construct privately, then publish through the same join boundary as fresh spawn. A failed codec cannot leave a partial live row. noSave types produce zero persisted records.

For a missing type/mod or unsupported payload version, preserve the original bounded record as opaque quarantined data, with zero ticks, collisions or tracking. Report the unavailable type once per load summary. Save preserves that record without rewriting its payload; reinstalling the mod permits a later load. Never silently delete it or instantiate a vanilla substitute. Invalid or over-budget records produce an explicit recoverable load error and retain the original region backup; never truncate into a valid-looking entity. Migration is explicit schema decoding, not an old-API compatibility path.

## Tracking and rendering handoff

Negotiate required type/schema/features before joining. A client missing a required entity implementation is refused with a clear reason before world state is sent. Map stable keys to connection-local protocol slots; server ids alone are insufficient. Interest entry sends one bounded spawn snapshot (identity, type, pose and explicitly synchronized fields); subsequent revisioned deltas follow declared update cadence. Late join receives current state, not replayed ticks. Interest exit, removal and dimension departure send one removal; reconnect gets a fresh snapshot. Ignore stale-incarnation deltas and request a bounded resnapshot after revision gaps.

Persistence does not imply synchronization: only declared fields cross the network. #813's shared payload transport should own attachment synchronization rather than adding a competing channel. Decode into client-owned tracked rows. Hand immutable render snapshots to a client type renderer through the existing drawing context; no server Part tick or mutable simulation access during drawing. Missing optional visual assets use a diagnostic visual; missing required behavior refuses connection. Resource reload disposes cached render resources without replacing entity identity.

The [moving-structures carrier](moving-structures.md) remains a game-owned specialized type and does not depend on general registration. Share identity, residency, tracking and save boundaries; its cell ownership, swept collision and assembly journal remain specialized. Never create two carrier tickers or serialize its cells twice.

## Lifecycle route owners and migration obligations

Paths below are verified existing integration owners relative to this repository. They identify boundaries to extend, not proof that general types already traverse them.

| Route | Existing file:line owner; required treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Part registration and dispatch | `crates/horizon-mod-vocab/src/parts/entities.rs:124` registers behavior; `:53` resolves a type's Parts. Resolve into slots at load. |
| Mod spawning, including callers using level handles | `crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_level_spawning.rs:15` owns level_spawn_mob. Add a general insertion path without pretending every entity is a mob. |
| Natural/spawner policy | `crates/horizon-client/src/game/mobs/natural_spawning.rs:43` gates eligible chunks. General MISC types do not gain natural spawning implicitly. Explicit spawn adapters use the same insertion boundary. |
| Identity, reads and queries | `crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_entity_refs.rs:101` resolves targets, `:176` creates refs, `:245` queries entities. Extend all three to general rows; do not scan families for each lookup. |
| Temporary lift | `crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_entity_refs.rs:86` owns held-out access. General rows must retain residency visibility and balance restoration after panic. |
| Residency insert/remove/unload/restore/world reset | `crates/horizon-client/src/join_seq/residency.rs:95` journals events, `:108` drains them, `:121` resets epoch. Integrate the general owner here; retirement waits for root commit. |
| Save and chunk reload | `crates/horizon-client/src/save.rs:3101` loads entity tags; `:3316` and `:3320` save synchronously/asynchronously. Both consume the same committed general snapshots, including quarantine. |
| Dimension/passenger transfer | `crates/horizon-client/src/game/entities/vehicle_teleport.rs:231` transfers vehicles, `:391` passengers. Validate the entire tree before moving any row. |
| Server tracking and ids | `crates/horizon-client/src/game/network/lan_entities.rs:130` runs native tracking, `:197` builds object states, `:578` supplies UUIDs, `:590` assigns ids. Include general rows once. |

Every creation source must reach the general insertion coordinator: summon, mod/fake-player spawn, item use, dispenser, projectile creation, breeding, natural and block spawners, conversion, chunk load and dimension arrival. Every exit must reach retirement: discard, death, despawn, conversion, chunk unload, dimension departure, disconnect-owned cleanup and world close. Client spawn/update/remove packets and renderer disposal require parallel coverage. Exact leaf owners for those sources, the authoritative general tick seam and client renderer/packet dispatch are **not yet verified** by this note; implementation must trace and record file:line callers before enabling them. Existing vanilla-only routes remain unchanged until explicitly migrated. This is a coverage gap, not an exhaustive verified caller inventory.

## Trust, native/wasm and cost

Native and wasm use the same registry, dependencies, state model and generated contract. Native exact-build checks and wasm interface linking remain loader concerns. Existing native-only registration is not evidence of wasm parity; enable this feature only when both adapters implement registration, tick, codecs and client handoff.

Treat registration, callback results, serialized input and packets as untrusted. Reject NaN/infinite positions or dimensions, negative/overflowed lengths, unknown owned type ids, duplicate UUIDs and stale handles before writes. Unrelated unknown ids retain their existing behavior. Propose payload limit 64 KiB per entity, nesting 32, passenger depth 16, positive dimensions at most 64 blocks, tracking at most 32 chunks and update interval 1–1200 ticks; confirm these provisional limits before implementation. Quarantined records of a missing mod are bounded too — 69 632 encoded bytes per record, 256 records per chunk; both provisional, with no vanilla analogue (vanilla deletes such entities rather than preserving them). Bound aggregate decoding and outgoing bytes per connection too.

Catch native unwinding and wasm traps at dispatch: abort the callback transaction, discard buffered effects, restore lifts, disable the failing subscriber and report it. A native process-aborting panic cannot be recovered. No irreversible external I/O inside transactional callbacks. A subsequent built-in action must still succeed.

No per-entity mod list, type-name lookup, serialized-data read or family scan. Indexed type dispatch costs O(1) plus actual subscribers; identity lookup O(1); one O(n) eligible-row walk is the necessary tick work. No subscribers means zero hook payload allocation and zero mod calls. Maintain interest/spatial indexes on movement and insertion, and encode only dirty tracked fields. Measure actual callee costs before claiming this bound; current string-based Part lookup alone does not prove it.

## Acceptance matrix

Future implementation tests, not results of this documentation change:

| Fixture | Concrete expected result |
| --- | --- |
| Register test:counter, spawn at (0,64,0), counter=40 | One general row, zero throwable rows; one server tick produces 41. |
| Two instances initially 40 and 7 | One tick gives 41 and 8; no shared mutable Part state. |
| Parent and passenger, each counter=0 | One phase gives 1 and 1; callback trace parent then passenger. |
| Callback spawns B during A's tick | B counter=0 at phase end, 1 after next phase. |
| Save at 41, reload, late client joins | Same UUID, counter=41, one client entity, zero template entities; first resumed tick gives 42. Old handle refuses. |
| Missing mod, save again, reinstall | Zero live rows/ticks/packets while absent; payload bytes preserved; reinstall restores counter=41. |
| Park for 10 ticks then resume | Counter stays 41 while parked, becomes 42 on first eligible tick. |
| Lift/restore and outer abort after tentative removal | Zero despawns, original join identity and counter=41 restored. Committed removal emits one despawn and retires holder once. |
| Transfer dimension with one passenger | Zero source rows, two destination rows, UUIDs unchanged; source handles refuse; one destination tick each. |
| Reuse runtime id 42 after removal | Old ref and old delta cannot affect replacement; replacement counter remains 7. |
| Join/reconnect/interest exit | One spawn snapshot per entry, one removal per exit, no server behavior on client. |
| Duplicate type, NaN pose, 65537-byte payload, passenger cycle | Refused with zero published rows/effects; next valid built-in step succeeds. |
| Native panic / wasm trap during tick | Counter and listener edits rolled back, balanced lift, zero outbound deltas; next valid built-in step succeeds. |
| No Parts on 1000 general entities | 1000 common ticks, zero callback calls and zero callback payload allocations; no per-entity scans. |

Run the scene on integrated, LAN and dedicated servers for both targets. Pin ordinary entity ordering and lifecycle behavior against vanilla oracles separately from Horizon-specific expected values.

## Proposed stages (file none)

1. Complete caller inventory, vanilla load/tick oracles and permitted 26.3 public-contract evidence; obtain Ari's decision on the issue.
2. Add frozen type registry, bounded codecs, general row/index and attachment identity; test duplicate keys and stale refs.
3. Integrate transactional insertion, retirement, residency, passenger transfer and committed save/quarantine; test rollback and recovery.
4. Generate behavior and both target adapters; integrate authoritative scheduling with explicit ordering tests.
5. Negotiate tracking, snapshot/delta transport and renderer handoff; test late join, reload and malformed packets.
6. Enable the acceptance scene only after all routes are audited and hot-path allocation/index measurements pass. No Rust or API changes belong to this note.

## Open questions

- Exact NeoForge 26.3 contract remains unavailable. Recommendation: obtain its public Javadoc before claiming counterpart parity; ask Ari to approve explicit Horizon choices where public documentation is silent.
- Must general ticks share one order with all vanilla families immediately? Recommendation: maintain stable general join order initially and require oracle evidence before migrating existing family scheduling.
- Missing-mod recovery versus fail-open world load? Recommendation: quarantine losslessly with visible diagnostics; malformed/oversized records require explicit recovery, never silent deletion.
- Which exact bounds are acceptable? Recommendation: start with the provisional limits above, measure valid workloads and agree aggregate world/connection quotas before enablement.
- Which EntityPart moments ship first? Recommendation: authoritative tick plus required lifecycle/codec integration only after matching existing named moments; do not invent parallel join/remove hooks. Coordinate with #779 and #796 before API generation.
- How does a vanilla client connect? Recommendation: refuse when required general types exist; approve a separate explicit protocol decision before advertising any vanilla-client representation.
