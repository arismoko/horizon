# Design: inside-block contact shapes

Provisional answer to [#1011](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/1011):
share the sweep decision, with an API-owned shape value and a restricted,
synchronous level/entity view. This is not an implemented API. No Rust changes
are proposed for immediate landing; agreement and oracle fixtures precede code.

## Vanilla and evidence

Vanilla 26.3 `Entity.checkInsideBlocks(Vec3, Vec3, collector, visited, limit)`
was inspected through `tools/rea_vanilla.py --overload-index 1 method
net.minecraft.world.entity.Entity checkInsideBlocks` using the vanilla inspection tool.
It skips air, queries `getEntityInsideCollisionShape`, evaluates block and fluid
intersection independently, then inserts the position into visited only if either
intersects. A newly visited position applies block effects first (only when block
intersection succeeds), then fluid effects (only when fluid intersection succeeds).
The canonical full-block shape has a special inclusion shortcut. Precision uses
movement distance and the deflated target box; it is not the custom shape overlap.
Preserve that distinction, iteration budgets, ordering, and movement segmentation.
A fluid-only hit must not call the block's entity_inside callback.

The issue names no NeoForge counterpart: this is a vanilla block method, not a
new event. Public [26.3 Block javadoc](https://aldak.netlify.app/javadoc/26.3.x/net/minecraft/world/level/block/Block.html)
was inaccessible during this investigation. NeoForge extensions, limits and exact
26.3 signatures remain **unverified**; require public documentation before adopting
any such contract. No NeoForge source, patches or other project's source was read.

## Current owners and proposed shared boundary

References verified at worktree HEAD `1d1de8d42b`; client paths below are relative
to `crates/horizon-client/src/`. These are current owners, not existing hook sites.

| Route | Owner | Required integration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Player movement | `motion.rs:1697`, `motion.rs:1806`, visitation `motion.rs:1912` | Replace local shape special cases with the shared decision; preserve built-in effects |
| Mob AI contact | `mobs/ai.rs:904`, `mobs/ai.rs:3314` | Route both contact traversals through the same accepted contact trace; avoid duplicate effects |
| Arrows | `arrows.rs:1253`, `arrows.rs:1287`, visitation `arrows.rs:1321` | Preserve collector step order and independent fluid processing |
| Dropped items | `entities.rs:960`, `ItemEntity::environment_tick` and `ItemEntity::stuck_multiplier` | Replace subscription-only admission and separate block-effect scans with shared geometry |
| Other projectiles / game entity batches | `game/mobs/creatures/mod.rs:205` | Same sweep adapter, bound to the actual entity |
| Generic sweep | `block_contact.rs:240`, visitation `block_contact.rs:257` | Shared geometry decision before recording contacts |
| Existing server callback | `game/native_hooks/entity_inside.rs:8`; catalog `crates/horizon-mod-vocab/src/hooks/entity_inside.rs:3` | The mid-walk notification moment is the one path now; the shape decision extends it, never filters after it |

Lower geometry prepares one candidate at a time in existing traversal order.
The game adapter fires the Part query with typed HostSide, then lower geometry
applies the validated shape and returns independent block/fluid bits. A common
restricted context must work while mob/entity collections are lifted: immutable
block/fluid state reads without chunk loads, position, entity bounds and existing
lifecycle entity/level handles. Unavailable reads return an explicit unavailable
result, never synthetic air. No mutable level borrow escapes into Parts.
Integrated, LAN and dedicated simulation use ServerHost for the acting entity;
client prediction uses ClientHost and cannot perform authoritative writes.
Remote interpolation is not an authoritative contact sweep. Predict only with
matching negotiated rules and rollback-owned state; otherwise defer custom contact
effects to the server. Implementation must verify each adapter above, including
all projectile kinds, rather than assume generic coverage from its name.

## Proposed Part and shape contract

The three capability choices are provisional decisions recorded in the
[maintainer decision comment](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/1011#issuecomment-6733587598).

Declare `get_entity_inside_collision_shape` beside `entity_inside`, one Part
method for this moment. Query synchronously before contact admission, independently
of whether entity_inside has subscribers. Existing block ownership resolves the
provider; do not introduce listener voting or a second contact engine.
Return API-owned Wire variants `Default`, `Empty`, `FullBlock`, or `Boxes` containing
owned block-local f64 AABBs. Default uses vanilla's complete shape semantics,
including powder snow, cauldrons, end portals and tripwire. FullBlock deliberately
selects vanilla's canonical-full-block shortcut; Boxes containing the unit cube
uses geometric testing. Document this distinction rather than infer shape identity
from equivalent coordinates. Add oracle fixtures comparing both against vanilla
before any code. The fluid shape is not replaced by this method.

Initial negotiated custom-shape capability: at most 256 boxes, finite coordinates in [-16,16],
strict min < max on each axis. Negative coordinates are valid; negative extents,
NaN, infinity and oversized arrays are invalid. These are provisional capability
limits, never limits on vanilla Default shapes or vanilla traversal capacity.
Validate length before allocation/decoding and reject the entire invalid result,
retaining Default and issuing a bounded diagnostic. Expose the negotiated budget
at registration; refuse unsupported requested capabilities with named
`UnsupportedInsideContactShapeCapability`, equally for native and wasm. Do not
silently approximate an unsupported voxel operation. Use explicit shared `#[derive(Wire)]` on API shape types; generate only native/wasm
call tables and adapters from the catalog; no engine VoxelShape or borrowed game pointer crosses it.

A per-state resolved provider bit makes unused dispatch O(1): no registry scan,
serialization, snapshots or extra allocation when no override exists. Existing
vanilla geometry/effect work remains. Subscription checks may skip notifications,
not fluid processing or built-in effects. Bound custom decoding and intersection
work by the advertised box count, without reducing vanilla's own capacity.

Candidate discovery preserves vanilla traversal: only visited cells are queried.
Out-of-cell coordinates do not expand discovery. A shape extending from (0,0,0)
into x = [-1,0] cannot admit an entity wholly in the neighboring cell unless the
origin cell is independently visited. This matches vanilla BlockGetter stationary
cell enumeration and the current geometry sweep; it is not a spatial shape index.

Before implementation, review a concrete query signature with typed HostSide, an
object-safe scoped read view, captured acting-entity facts and structured refusal
variants. The provisional read surface is immutable loaded block and fluid reads
plus captured facts of the acting entity, through a scoped object-safe read
capability. No mutation during selection. Under a lifted pass, an unavailable read
is an explicit refusal, never inferred as "the entity is gone".

Bound total custom work as well as each response: 256 boxes contain 12,288
coordinate bytes before tags and lengths per candidate. Define aggregate read/query
accounting and exhaustion behavior before implementation. Before the numbers
freeze, the implementation adds aggregate per-tick read/query accounting and
measures the real wasm crossing cost. If the measurement says the numbers are
wrong, they change then. Preserve vanilla traversal capacity and the unused fast path.

## Lifecycle, transactions and failure

Use existing lifecycle holders for entity and level identity; no second generation
counter. A candidate captures entity identity, movement segment, state/position,
and relevant world revision. Apply rechecks them in the same transaction as query
writes and refuses a stale decision, rolling back writes; never recompute after a
callback mutates the environment. Prefer a read-only query capability so shape
selection cannot mutate its own preconditions. Any permitted attachment writes
must remain rollback-owned. During lifted passes defer retirement and external
effect journal emission to root commit; no notification or packet escapes an
aborted candidate. Refuse saves during an open action savepoint through the
existing save coordinator, not a second save service.

Native unwind or wasm trap discards that invocation's output and writes, selects
Default and disables the faulty provider for the session with a bounded diagnostic.
Native abort is unrecoverable. Both targets use identical validation and recovery
semantics. Existing entity_inside notification remains at its documented batch
boundary; geometry acceptance and effect ordering are captured in the sweep trace,
not reconstructed from a later callback against a changed block.

## Baseline and acceptance matrix

Issue #1011 requires unchanged no-override contacts and ordering. That is the
required baseline for this feature. Current player motion explicitly skips tripwire
and end portals (`motion.rs`, `check_inside_blocks`); vanilla queries their shapes.
Thus exact vanilla parity cannot simultaneously describe the existing baseline.
Capture current per-route traces first; introduce any vanilla parity correction
separately with maintainer agreement before rebasing those fixtures. The proposed
complete vanilla Default semantics remain a target, not an approved baseline change.

“Block then fluid” below means callback/collection order. The collector subsequently
orders effects by kind within each step; do not equate collection order with final
effect execution order.

Implementation requirements, not runtime results obtained for this note. Shapes
and boxes below use block-local coordinates for a stationary candidate at (0,0,0).
Run each on player, mob, arrow, item and every projectile adapter, native and wasm.

| Fixture | Expected result |
| --- | --- |
| Empty, no fluid | visited 0; block callbacks 0; fluid effects 0 |
| FullBlock, centered entity box [.25,.75] on all axes | visited 1; block callbacks 1 |
| Boxes unit cube, centered box | visited 1; block callbacks 1 |
| FullBlock versus Boxes unit cube, vanilla oracle fixtures before any code | compare both against vanilla; preserve canonical identity shortcut versus geometric testing |
| Shape selection reads under a lifted pass | immutable loaded block/fluid reads and captured acting-entity facts only through scoped object-safe capability; unavailable read explicitly refused; no mutation |
| Initial negotiated 256-box / [-16,16] capability | aggregate per-tick read/query accounting and real wasm crossing cost measured before numbers freeze; revise numbers if measurement requires; no vanilla ceiling |
| Boxes [0,0,0]–[1,.5,1], entity y [.6,.9] | visited 0; block callbacks 0 |
| Same shape, entity y [.25,.4] | visited 1; block callbacks 1 |
| Empty block shape, intersecting fluid | visited 1; block callbacks 0; fluid effects 1 |
| Both intersect, candidate repeated twice | visited 1; trace block then fluid, each once |
| Neither intersects on first segment, fluid intersects on second | first segment does not mark visited; second produces fluid once |
| 257 boxes, NaN, infinity, reversed or zero extents | whole result rejected; Default result equals baseline |
| Provider traps after attachment write | attachment unchanged; Default contact; provider disabled |
| Entity retired or state/revision changes before apply | stale decision refused; zero committed effects |
| Root abort during lifted pass | no retirement or journal emission; save request refused while savepoint open |
| Default / no override | unchanged captured Horizon contacts and order on every route; separately record vanilla oracle differences across short/long moves and special blocks |
| Empty on dropped-item fire/cactus/lava-cauldron/cobweb/powder-snow contact | applicable block damage, ignition and slowing suppressed; independent fluid effects and existing burning timers preserved |
| Origin block shape x [-1,0], entity wholly in neighboring cell, stationary | origin not queried; no origin block callback or effect |
| Override with no entity_inside listeners | geometry still controls built-in block effects; fluid unaffected |

## Proposed stages

File none for implementation at this stage. First agree representation, restricted
context and failure semantics; obtain vanilla oracle traces for special shapes,
fluid-only contact and the full-block shortcut. Then implement the shared sweep
with unchanged default-only behavior across every route; resolve recorded vanilla differences separately. Finally add the catalog Part query,
generated native/wasm transport, registration refusal, docs, sample and behavioral
fixtures together. No player-only intermediate public API should ship.
