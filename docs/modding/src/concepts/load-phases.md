# Load phases and access

A mod's code runs in phases. What a hook may touch depends on the phase it runs in: there is no `Host` while
the mod registers, and no world until the World phase.

![Each game thread goes through Packages, Registration, Setup, Config and World, in order; a data or asset reload
enters Reloading and returns to the phase it came from.](../images/load-phases.svg)

Native and wasm hooks share the installed dependency-ordered mod slice, including registration,
config loading and reload-listener registration. The shared resolver keeps bundle-order ties,
checks present optional dependencies too, and refuses cycles for both build targets. Content-only
packages stay after code in the loaded-mod inventory; listener-specific edges use `ReloadOrder`.

Each owning thread progresses through `Packages → Registration → Setup → Config → World`.

| Phase | Available access |
| --- | --- |
| Packages | Package discovery; no game Host operations. |
| Registration | Declarations through `RegistrationContext`, with its mod-list, registry and settings reads; no Host. |
| Setup | Client setup reads, published asset/data queries and registry/settings/mod-list reads; no world handles or transactions. |
| Config | Settings reads and the mod-scoped `ConfigFiles` service; no world handles, transactions or other game operations. |
| Reloading | Published asset/data queries, registry facts, settings and mod-list reads, listener registration, and `DataLoadContext` callbacks; no world handles or transactions. |
| World | The owning game's side-typed `ServerHost` or `ClientHost`. |

`RegistrationContext::instance_dir()` reads the instance directory captured before
registration begins, as an `InstanceDirectory`: `Unix(Vec<u8>)` preserves raw Unix
path bytes, and `Windows(Vec<u16>)` preserves Windows UTF-16 code units, including
unpaired surrogates. Never convert Unix bytes with a lossy UTF-8 conversion when
constructing a native filesystem path. Wasm receives the identical host-encoded
value through Wire as data only; this does not grant filesystem access. A context
with no engine snapshot returns `RegistrationReadError::Unavailable`.

## Registration and setup

Registration runs once: `register`, `component_types`, `blocks`, `items` and `standalone_models`
receive no `Host` and read startup facts through `RegistrationContext`.
`register` also receives `&mut dyn Registrar` for writing declarations. The context's `mods()`, `registry(name)` and `setting(mod_id, key)` read
one view captured before the first of them runs, so every registration step sees the same values
whatever the dispatch order: the loaded packages, the built-in registries as `registries.json`
lists them (not what mods declare during registration) and the settings on disk when the snapshot is captured. A
mod validates the keys it declares against them from `Hooks::register`; a name that is not a
namespaced identifier, an unknown registry, an empty or path-like setting key, a package that is
not loaded, or a context the engine gave no data returns a `RegistrationReadError`. Client setup
runs once after the initial asset apply. The window's Client/Common configs load once immediately after client setup and before title,
connection, input, render or ordinary tick callbacks. This includes pack-error recovery: the failed
selection is cleared and saved during initialization, but its options screen opens only after Config
completes. A title-screen callback is already in World: world-handle constructors can return `None`,
rather than being forbidden in Setup. A dedicated
server loads Common once before its first world; Server configs load and unload per world.
A second world does not repeat registration or client setup. Config loading can read settings and
use the scoped `ConfigFiles` service to read or save its own config files. World handles,
transactions and other game operations panic with `Config` in the diagnostic.
Config file polling is not a phase transition, and Server config unloading leaves the World phase.

## Reloading

Every data or asset reload enters `Reloading`, including listener registration, prepare, apply and
the reload completion notice. Initial loads can nest in Setup; runtime reloads nest in World.
Returning, including after a failed prepare, restores the entering phase. Published asset/data
queries read the published generation, not pending prepare output: completion callbacks can
refresh sprite and recipe caches after apply, including on first world open, without gaining world
handles or transactions. Their rustdoc names their load-phase availability. Server listener
registration retains `&dyn Host`, restricted to these published facts, registry facts, settings and
mod-list queries. Callbacks that take `DataLoadContext` use its restricted reads. Neither permits
opening a world handle or transaction. The first client registration and prepare run on the loader
thread; later registration runs on the render thread, prepare on its worker, and apply on the owning
game thread.

## Load contexts

`DataLoadContext` and `LoopContext` expose frozen registry and settings metadata. Use
`DataLoadOrigin` to identify the load origin and `LoopSide` to identify the owning side.
Registry entries retain registry ID order on native and wasm.

In World, both client and server hosts expose `registry_entry(registry, id)`,
`registry_entries(registry)` and `registry_entry_in_tag(&entry, tag)`. These read the
current side's live registry and merged tags, not pending reload data. Unknown or
unavailable registries and entries return `None`; an absent tag or a tag that does
not contain the entry returns `Some(false)`. Enumeration yields each identity once.

Server world-generation reads use the published decoded owners, including the
live feature data in worlds without a terrain locator. Invalid source files do
not establish entries. Prepared world-preset files have no published complete
registry owner, so `minecraft:worldgen/world_preset` is unavailable; selecting a
preset, sharing generator resources or reopening a saved stem does not change that.

`RegistryEntry` is a plain Wire value containing `registry: Identifier` and
`id: Identifier`, identical on native and wasm. Its names may be retained across
reloads; constructing the value does not establish that the entry exists.
`as_block_key(host)`, `as_item_key(host)` and the corresponding narrowing methods
for block entity types, boolean game rules, dimensions, effects, enchantments,
entity types, fluids, menus and particles resolve a real host-issued typed key.
A different registry or unknown entry returns `None`. Typed keys remain
process-local; narrowing never treats a protocol numeric ID as a key slot.

Mod-declared datapack registries resolve tags against the accepted candidate
before publication; tags with missing required members are omitted. Synchronized
snapshots carry those exact tag names and members (including empty tags);
server-only and unnegotiated registries send neither entries nor tags. Clients
validate membership before activating a snapshot.
On clients, generic reads never fall back to prepared server-only datapack files:
built-ins and the connection's currently synchronized registries are the entire view.

The game alone advances phases. An illegal or wrong-thread advance is refused before dispatch;
a forbidden mod call panics naming the phase, rather than returning a `Result`.
There is no separate common-setup, load-complete or intermod event: registration and the first server
reload cover common setup, client setup is `client_setup`, dedicated setup is `server_about_to_start`,
and dependencies express intermod ordering. Load complete is the edge after initial Config and before
`server_about_to_start`, not a hook.

## Settings snapshot limits

Settings snapshots accept regular UTF-8 files only. File and package-directory symlinks,
including internal links, are not followed. Invalid UTF-8, special files and refused entries
are absent from the snapshot rather than reported as read errors.

| Limit | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| 64 KiB per file, before trimming | Oversized values are omitted. |
| 1,024 captured keys per mod | Additional keys are omitted. |
| 16 MiB for the snapshot, before trimming | Values exceeding the remaining budget are omitted. |
| 4,096 enumerated names per package | A package exceeding the budget is omitted entirely. |

Capture proceeds in sorted package-ID and key-name order. The game emits one warning per
refusal class per snapshot. These limits apply to scalar settings, not mod data files.
