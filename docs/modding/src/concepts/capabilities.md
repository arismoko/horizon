# Capabilities

Use capability providers to expose a block's storage to pipes, machines and hoppers. Register a
provider for a block entity type, including a vanilla type, or for a block with or without a block entity.
For example, during registration, obtain `pipe` from your declaration builder or
`r.block_entity_type_key("mymod:pipe")`, then supply your handler:

```rust,ignore
r.block_entity_capability(&ITEMS, &pipe, |_, at| {
    Some(Box::new(PipeItems(at)))
});
```

Here, `PipeItems` is your implementation of `ResourceHandler<ItemResource>`. Its `BlockSide` context
contains the level, position and requested side. Return `None` to let another provider answer.
This registration corresponds to NeoForge's `RegisterCapabilitiesEvent`.

## Register and look up providers

| Operation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `r.block_entity_capability(&ITEMS, &kind, provider)` | The provider receives `&mut dyn ServerHost` and `BlockSide`. |
| `r.block_capability(&ITEMS, &block, provider)` | The provider also receives the `BlockState` and `Option<BlockEntityRef>` at the position. Obtain `block` with `r.block_key("mymod:void_bin")`. |
| `r.block_entity_capability_before_game(...)` / `r.block_capability_before_game(...)` | Register a provider ahead of the game's provider. |
| `level.capability(host, &ITEMS, pos, side)` | Look up a handler on a `LevelRef`; `side` is `Option<Direction>`, with `None` meaning no particular side. The result is `Option<Capability<dyn ResourceHandler<ItemResource>>>`. |
| `r.is_block_capability_registered(&KEY, &block)` | Whether any game or mod provider registered so far covers this block type. |
| `r.is_entity_capability_registered(&KEY, &entity_type)` | The same type-coverage query for an `EntityTypeKey`, obtained with `r.entity_type_key("minecraft:pig")`. |
| `r.is_item_capability_registered(&KEY, &item)` | The same query for an `ItemKey`, obtained with `r.item_key("minecraft:stick")`. |

A block provider can expose a trash can that voids items or forward a multiblock port to its controller.
A block with a block entity can have both kinds of provider.

Lookup uses this order:

1. Providers registered with `_before_game`.
2. The game's provider: for `ITEMS`, container slots exposed by side using the rules hoppers follow,
   including slots declared with `r.block_container(&block, container)` (`ModContainer`).
3. Other registered providers.

Within each mod-provider group, block and block entity type providers form one list in registration
order. The first `Some` wins; handlers are not merged. Use `_before_game` when you need priority over
the game's handler, but do not assume precedence over another mod at the same priority.
Disabled mods' providers are skipped. A stale level handle or a level that is not in place returns
`None` without asking providers.

Registration queries see the game's coverage, earlier mods in registration order, and providers already
added by the current mod; they do not see later registrations. For example, `ITEMS` covers
`minecraft:chest` without a mod provider. Use these queries to add a fallback only when no provider
covers the type. This is type coverage, not a promise that a lookup at a particular position, side,
entity or item place will return a handler.
Declarations made in a later phase, such as `register_cauldron_fluid_content` after registry resolution,
are not visible yet; these queries never run future registration callbacks.
The same registrar owns default storage declarations: `block_container(&block, ModContainer)`,
`block_fluids(&block, ModFluidTanks)`, `block_energy(&block, ModEnergyBuffer)` and
`item_container(&item, provider)`. Their declarations supply both the game's runtime handlers and
registration-time coverage; the item provider's dynamic slot callback is never invoked by a coverage query.
The three block-storage declarations accept mod blocks only, not `minecraft` blocks; use
`block_capability` to expose storage on a vanilla block. The first enabled declaration for a block
type supplies its default storage. Item-container declarations may target vanilla items too, and
their callbacks run in registration order until one returns `Some`.

One capability supports at most 65,535 providers per block or block entity type. The next registration
is refused at load with a message naming the mod, capability and target and stating that the target
already has the most providers it may have.

Declare your own capability with `CapabilityKey::new("mymod:chemicals")`. Only registered providers
answer it; it has no game-provided handler. A `Capability` wraps the handler and identifies its
provider through `owner()`.

## Proxy metadata

Block capabilities are non-proxyable by default. The defining mod can call
`r.set_capability_proxyable(&KEY, true)` to declare that requests can safely be forwarded to other
blocks, or explicitly mark `false` when forwarding is unsafe. Repeating the same explicit value,
including from another mod, is allowed; an opposite explicit value refuses registration rather than
letting the last writer win. Merely reading the default `false` does not explicitly mark it.

During registration, `r.block_capability_names()` and `r.block_capability_proxyable(name)` expose
the capabilities discovered so far. After publication, use `block_capability_names(host)`,
`block_capability_proxyable(host, name)` and `block_capability_proxyable_names(host)`; the last
returns precisely the known names whose proxyability reads `true`. These owned snapshots use the
same published metadata on native and wasm. Proxyability is metadata for forwarding mods, not a
change to provider lookup order or a guarantee that a provider will answer.

These rules follow NeoForge 26.3's
[`BlockCapability`](https://aldak0.ru/javadoc/26.3.x/net/neoforged/neoforge/capabilities/BlockCapability.html)
and [`RegisterCapabilitiesEvent`](https://aldak0.ru/javadoc/26.3.x/net/neoforged/neoforge/capabilities/RegisterCapabilitiesEvent.html).

## Read and move items

`ITEMS` handlers implement `ResourceHandler<ItemResource>`, corresponding to NeoForge 26.3's
`ResourceHandler<ItemResource>`. An `ItemResource` identifies an item and its components without a count.
Each method receives the host; the handler holds no borrow of the game.

| Method | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `size` | Number of indices, numbered from 0. |
| `resource` | Resource at an index, or `None`. |
| `amount` | Amount held at an index. |
| `capacity` | `u32` limit for a specified resource, independent of the index's current contents. This is neither free space nor permission to insert. |
| `is_valid` | Whether the resource is allowed at an index. The default checks for nonzero capacity; override it for separate acceptance rules and enforce those rules in `insert`. |
| `insert` / `extract` | Insert or extract up to the requested amount at an index, using a `&Transaction`; return the amount moved. Insertion can refuse even with nonzero capacity. |

Keep handler state in transaction-managed storage such as block entity slots, saved compounds or
attachments. Your handler can look up and call a neighbour's capability through the host.

Use `move_resources(host, &from, &to, filter, max, tx)` to transfer matching resources, up to `max`,
from source indices in order into any destination index that accepts them. Each transfer uses a nested
transaction: rejected items stay in the source, and partial acceptance is retried with the accepted
amount. The result is `Result<u32, Overanswered>`. If a handler reports more than requested, its transfer
is undone and `Overanswered` identifies the provider in `owner`. Propagate the error from your
`host.transaction` closure to abort the whole operation.

There is no `simulate` parameter. To try an operation without keeping its changes, run it in a
transaction and return `Err` to abort. See [Transactions](transactions.md).
Hoppers use registered block and block entity type handlers, with each move in its own transaction.

Look up a neighbour once per tick and reuse the `Capability` for that tick's moves. Look it up again
on the next tick because the block entity may have been removed. Reusing a lookup also avoids repeated
sandbox crossings for wasm mods.
