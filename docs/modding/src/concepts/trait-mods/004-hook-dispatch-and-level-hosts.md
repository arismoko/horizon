<!-- chapter: Hook dispatch and level hosts -->
<!-- separator: 1 -->

A linked trait mod implements `mod_api::Hooks`. A hook function is not an injection point, so
`[[inject]]` never runs inside a hook's dispatch; a `head` injection that cancels the game function
calling a hook keeps the hook from firing at all. A claimed cancellation reaches only trait listeners that receive cancelled events.
Otherwise, trait mods run by priority, then in dependency order. Once a mod cancels, later mods are skipped unless
they receive cancelled events. For replacement hooks, the first `Some` wins. Collection hooks call every mod.
Receiverless hooks have no `Host`.

To save from inside a hook, use `level.request_save(host)` so the save runs at the next settled
start-of-tick boundary. A synchronous `save-all` while an entity pass or held-out row is borrowed
fails with vanilla's `commands.save.failed` feedback and a failed command result, without saving.

To emit a vibration-producing game event, use `level.game_event(host, event, at, context)`.
`GameEventContext` carries an optional source entity and affected block state; see
[game events with context](../../how-to/game-events.md) for listener semantics and refusals.

`#[listener]` on a hook method sets both, as NeoForge's `EventPriority` and `receiveCanceled` do. Two mods, each
its own crate:

```rust
#[mod_api::horizon_mod]
impl Hooks for Protection {
    // Runs before mods at the default priority, 0; higher runs first.
    #[listener(priority = 100)]
    fn break_block(&self, host: &mut dyn ServerHost, event: &mut BreakBlockEvent<'_>) -> Flow {
        if self.protected(host, event.pos) { Flow::Cancel } else { Flow::Continue }
    }
}

#[mod_api::horizon_mod]
impl Hooks for Override {
    // Still told after a cancel, and may undo it.
    #[listener(priority = -100, receive_cancelled)]
    fn break_block(&self, host: &mut dyn ServerHost, event: &mut BreakBlockEvent<'_>) -> Flow {
        if event.cancelled && self.allowed(host, event.pos) {
            event.cancelled = false;
        }
        Flow::Continue
    }
}
```

`priority` is an `i32`, 0 when omitted; mods of equal priority keep dependency order, as `[[inject]]`
priorities do ([Injections](../../injections.md#ordering)). Each hook's order is fixed once, when the mods are
installed. Every cancellable hook's event has a `cancelled` field: a mod without `receive_cancelled` always sees
`false`, since it is not called once the event is cancelled. A mod that receives cancelled events and sets it back to
`false` lets the game's behaviour run, and the mods after it are told again. An event the game hands over already
cancelled reaches only mods that receive cancelled events. `receive_cancelled` on a hook without a cancel does not
compile, and `#[listener]` is for a trait mod's hooks only: a part is called for its own thing, in no order.

Native and wasm trait mods use the same listener ordering and cancellation rules. Wasm subscription records carry the hook name, signed priority, and receive-cancelled flag through the shared-memory Wire boundary at load time. The event's `cancelled` field crosses with its other writable fields. No component-model adapter is involved.

Each hook method takes its host, where it has one, and one event:

```rust
fn living_incoming_damage(
    &self,
    _level: &mut dyn LevelRandomHost,
    event: &mut LivingIncomingDamageEvent<'_>,
) -> Flow {
    if event.kind == "minecraft:pig" {
        let halved = event.container.new_damage() * 0.5;
        event.container.set_new_damage(halved);
    }
    Flow::Continue
}
```

The event is a generated struct named after the catalog hook, in CamelCase plus `Event`, with
the hook point's arguments as public fields: values as values and borrowed ones as references (`event.kind`). A
number or `bool` a mod may change is a plain field, written back once every mod has run, even after a `Cancel`;
anything else a mod may change, a game struct or a list, is a `&mut` field. A cancellation or replacement is still
the return value; a collection hook's list is a field (`event.lines`). One event goes through every mod, so each
sees the changes before it. Because no mod can build or match the whole
struct, a later version can add a field without breaking any mod, as NeoForge's event objects do; the cost is that
a mod's own tests drive a hook through its dispatch function ([Testing a trait mod](026-testing-a-trait-mod.md#testing-a-trait-mod)).

Hook methods take `&self` and require `Send + Sync`. The process-wide mod list is installed once, like mixin module statics. One mod instance serves both
the window's game and the server-thread game. A hook can also fire again inside
the same mod: for example, `LevelRef::set_block` fires `block_changed`. Mods keep mutable
state with interior mutability so these calls can share the instance safely. Data-load
hooks can run on any loading thread; item default changes must be identical on every side.

The trait has every hook declared under `crates/horizon-mod-vocab/src/hooks/` ([Adding a hook](027-adding-a-hook.md#adding-a-hook)).
Level hooks use access-specific hosts rather than `Host`. `LevelHost` provides
`block_state` through `LevelAccess::block_state`, client-side detection and
`state_with_property`. `state_string(state)` serializes the full name and properties, or returns `None`
for an unknown state; `min_y()` and `height()` read the level's build range. It also reads light and loaded state, through the game's own queries:
`brightness(LightLayer::Block | Sky, pos)` (`getBrightness`, the stored 0 to 15),
`raw_brightness(pos, sky_darken)` (`getRawBrightness`, which `CropBlock.randomTick` asks with 0)
and `is_loaded(pos)` (`Level.isLoaded`: inside the build height and in a loaded chunk),
`is_raining_at(pos)` (`Level.isRainingAt`, false where `pos` is not loaded) and `enabled_features()`
(`LevelReader.enabledFeatures`, a borrowed `FeatureFlags<'_>`). Neither allocates.
None of them loads a chunk. Light above the build height reads as full sky and below it as
none, and a chunk that isn't loaded reads as the game's query does (full sky, no block light),
so check `is_loaded` first. It also answers tag and fluid questions without a `Host`: `block_in_tag(block_key, tag)`,
`fluid_state(pos)` (`getFluidState`, `None` where the block read is),
`state_fluid_state(state)` and `fluid_in_tag(fluid_name, tag)`. Fluid reads return `FluidState` with a
`FluidKey`, amount, falling flag and engine-derived source flag; `is_empty()` and `is_source()` report
those states without a registry lookup. `block_state_id(name)` parses a block and properties, and `block_state_default(block)` gives a block's default state, as on `Host`; both return `None` for invalid input or unavailable context. Tag reads are `None` when authoritative tags are unavailable, including on a client before its server's tags are applied. For item membership and member lists, use `Host::tags()`: resolve a `TagKey` with `Tags::key`, then call `Tags::is_in_tag`, `Tags::items` or `Tags::fluids`. Membership reads return `None` on clients until server-sent tags are applied, which `tags_updated` announces; they never substitute local resource-pack tags.
`LevelHost` has no random, by design: a draw from a read-only hook inside a level write would shift the level's random sequence away from vanilla's order. A hook that may draw is given a `LevelRandomHost`.
`LevelRandomHost` provides vanilla's `Level.random` so
mod draws come in vanilla's order. `LevelTicksHost` adds scheduling through
`native_schedule_block_tick` and `native_schedule_fluid_tick`, while
`LevelWriteHost` adds random access, `set_block`, `set_block_property`, `native_play_sound` and
`native_send_particles` and `native_level_event` (`levelEvent`, queued in order with the write's own events).
`set_block(pos, state, flags)` is `Level.setBlock` on a whole state, as `LevelRef::set_block` takes it: it
removes the old block's block entity and creates the new block's in the write (`LevelChunk.setBlockState`), runs
the neighbour and shape updates `flags` ask for, and queues the write's level events in order. A mod block entity
it creates starts with the data the `block_entity` hook gives, which is fired in the write and receives the level
(`LevelSide`, read-only: vanilla's `newBlockEntity` gets no level), as the `Host`'s `native_set_block` fires it. It returns true when the block
changed, and false off an authoritative server, for a position that is not loaded or outside the build height,
an invalid state, or the state the block already has. It never loads a chunk. The game owns
the tick queue; mods do not pass it back to these helpers.
Frame drawing through `DrawContext`, `BlockEntityDrawContext` and `WorldDrawContext` stays
in `mod_api`. Raw GPU access is native-only, unstable and outside that API, in
`mod_render::render` (`horizon-mod-render`). Replace its frame functions with native HEAD mixins compiled against the prebuilt game.
`render_needs` collects requests; `world_drawn` runs before the hand and HUD, and
`hand_drawn` runs after the hand, on the render thread. API draw contexts remain
unchanged; use them for API-typed drawing.
