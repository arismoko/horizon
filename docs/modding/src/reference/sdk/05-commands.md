# Commands

The `cargo horizon-mod` commands that read the SDK. One tool serves every build: it reads each build's data from its
SDK, fetched as [In a mod project](03-in-a-project.md) says, and refuses a schema it doesn't know. Run them in a mod's
folder.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `new <path> --template native\|wasm [--horizon <build>]` | Makes a code mod pinned to the current Nightly's build, or the one named, and fetches its SDK. Without `--template` it makes a content mod, which has no SDK. |
| `build`, `build --wasm` | Fetches the pinned SDK when needed, then packs the `.hmod` with its [`uses.json`](04-fit.md#usesjson). |
| `check [--uses]` | The package rules, then, for a code mod, fetches the pinned SDK when needed and runs `cargo check` for this computer and for wasm32, then what the mod uses of its pinned build: `Greeter uses 14 items of the API (6 hooks, 5 methods, 3 types). Made for nightly-2026-11-13 (afe471c).` `--uses` lists each item with the line that brought it in, and how the mod builds each struct it builds with a literal. |
| `hooks <text> [--all]` | Searches the pinned build's hooks offline, by id, doc and their NeoForge, Fabric and Paper names; every word must match. `--all` searches every record. Matches in the id come first, then in a counterpart, then in the doc. |
| `sdk diff <build> <build>` | What changed in the surface from the first build to the second, [classified](02-surface.md#what-a-change-is). It reads only the builds' small files, so it works for builds whose compiled files are pruned. |
| `fits [<file.hmod>] [--build <build>]…` | Whether the mod, or a package, fits the current Nightly or each build named: one line per build, `made for`, `fits`, or `does not fit` with the changed items. |
| `update [--horizon <build>] [--accept <id>]…` | For a native mod: prints what moving the pin to the current Nightly (or the build named) breaks in this mod, then moves it. |

## `fits`

`fits` exits 0 when every build fits, 1 when one does not, and 2 when it cannot tell: an input it cannot read or
fetch, or a question that doesn't apply (a content mod, a mod made for exactly one build, a package made by an older
tool). A mod's own scheduled CI can run it to learn of a break before players do:

```text
Greeter:
nightly-2026-11-13 (afe471c)  made for
nightly-2026-11-14 (0c1d2e3)  fits
nightly-2026-11-20 (9a8b7c6)  does not fit: 2 items changed
    the hook `player_logged_in` (changed)
    the method `ServerHost::give_item` (removed)
```

## `update`

Before it repins, `update` lists every item the mod uses that changed between the two builds, the source line that
uses it, for a removed item the closest one in the new build (one with the same counterpart name first, then the
nearest id and doc text), and the change note's `migrate` line when the change has one. A mod made for exactly one
build is only named; its internals and `[[inject]]` declarations are checked as the pin moves, and a change to an
injection's point refuses the update until `--accept <inject id>` takes it.

The same checks without the tool, from a build's `surface.json` and a mod folder, are `horizon-stage uses` and
`horizon-stage fits` ([Checking a mod against a build](../../how-to/native-mods/14-checking-a-mod-against-a-build.md)).
