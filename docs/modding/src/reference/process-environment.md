# The process, versions and game tests

A mod can ask which kind of process it runs in and which game it runs on, before it declares anything.

## From registration

`RegistrationContext` gives these before any declaration is registered:

| Method | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| `dist()` | `Dist::Client` in the physical client process (its integrated server included), `Dist::DedicatedServer` in a dedicated server |
| `game_version()` | Minecraft's version, exactly `horizon_core::VANILLA_VERSION` |
| `horizon_version()` | Horizon's version, the string crash reports print |
| `game_tests_enabled()` | Whether the process runs with game tests on |

`dist()` names the process, not the logical side of the hook that is running: a hook on the integrated server of a
client process still sees `Dist::Client`.

## From a host

The `Host` gives the same distribution and versions on both sides, and `game_tests_enabled()` on a server host. All
values are captured once, before mods register, and are the same for native and WebAssembly mods.

## Game tests

Game tests are off by default. Turn them on with `--game-tests` on the game's command line (before or after
`--dedicated`), or with `HORIZON_GAME_TESTS=1` or `HORIZON_GAME_TESTS=true` in the environment; other values
leave them off. With the mode on, a mod may declare content meant only for tests. `register_game_tests` runs on
every world open whatever the mode, and `/test` is always available.

The switch counts only where an option is expected: `--dedicated --world --game-tests` opens the world named
`--game-tests` and leaves test mode off. The dedicated server's `--universe`, `--port`, `--serverId` and
`--pidFile` likewise take the next word as their value.
