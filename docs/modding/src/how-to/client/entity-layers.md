# Drawing a layer over a living entity

A client mod can draw over a living entity without replacing its model: a mod's armour, a glow, a
backpack, something held or worn. This is the counterpart of NeoForge 26.3's
`EntityRenderersEvent.AddLayers` and `RenderLayer`: the mod adds a layer to a living entity type or to
a player model, and the game draws it over every entity of that target in view, after its model and
the layers before it. Native and wasm mods add and draw layers the same way.

## 1. Write the layer

A layer implements `EntityRenderLayer`. Its `submit` gets the entity's frame, a humanoid model's posed
parts and a draw context, the one a mob or block entity submit hook draws with (`quad`, `cube`,
`block`, `item`, `model_part`, `push`, `pop`, `translate`, `rotate_about`, `scale`):

```rust,ignore
use mod_api::*;
use std::sync::Arc;

struct Halo;
impl EntityRenderLayer for Halo {
    fn submit(
        &self,
        _entity: &EntityRenderState,
        _parts: Option<&PosedParts>,
        draw: &mut dyn BlockEntityDrawContext,
    ) -> Result<(), String> {
        // In the entity's frame: at its feet, turned with its body. Any atlas sprite will do:
        // a vanilla one, as here, or one of the mod's own assets.
        let face = Some(CubeFace::new("block/gold_block"));
        draw.cube([-4.0, 34.0, -4.0], [4.0, 35.0, 4.0], [face; 6], 0xFFFFFF);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

The pose stack starts in the entity's frame: at its feet, turned with its body, +z the way it faces,
+x its left, +y up, in blocks, as `render_living_pre` draws. `entity.yaw` is the body's turn and
`entity.pitch` the head's; `parts` has a humanoid model's parts as vanilla posed them this frame, to
attach to an arm or the head (None for a model that isn't humanoid). `draw` also has the partial tick,
the game time and the entity's light. Every entity of a target shares the one layer, so keep
per-entity values out of it. A layer has no `Host`; one that needs the world reads it in a hook and
keeps what it read.

## 2. Add it

```rust,ignore
fn register_entity_layers(
    &self,
    _context: &RegistrationContext,
    event: &mut RegisterEntityLayersEvent<'_>,
) {
    let halo = Arc::new(Halo);
    for target in [
        LayerTarget::Entity("minecraft:zombie".into()),
        LayerTarget::Player(PlayerModel::Wide),
        LayerTarget::Player(PlayerModel::Slim),
    ] {
        event.layers.add(target, halo.clone()).unwrap();
    }
}
```

The hook is asked on every resource load, the first one and every reload (F3+T, a resource pack
change), after the entity renderers resolve: a reload builds the renderers again, and layers don't
carry over, so add them each time. The event also tells what renderers this load built:

| Method | Tells |
| --- | --- |
| `entity_types()` | every entity type with a renderer, vanilla's and the mods', sorted (not `minecraft:player`: a player's renderers are its models') |
| `is_living(type)` | whether the type's renderer is a living entity's, the only kind that takes layers |
| `player_models()` | `Wide` and `Slim` |
| `has_mod_renderer(type)` | whether a mod registered the type's renderer ([entity renderers](entity-renderers.md)) |

- A layer attaches only to a living renderer, a mod's own included. `add` refuses a target that is no
  entity type, a type whose renderer isn't a living one (a boat, a display, a projectile),
  `minecraft:player`, whose layers go to a player model, and a living type that draws through a route
  of its own which doesn't run layers yet (the armour stand, the ender dragon): the `Err` names the
  target, and the game logs it too.
- Several mods may add to one target: the layers draw in the order they were added, after the
  entity's model and its vanilla layers.
- An entity whose `render_living_pre` or `render_player_pre` a mod canceled draws none of its layers,
  as NeoForge's canceled `RenderLivingEvent.Pre` skips them.
- `submit` returns `Ok(())` to keep what it drew. A layer that returns an `Err`, panics, or (in a wasm
  mod) has its call refused or trapped is logged once and asked no more until the next resource load
  adds it again; what it drew that frame is dropped.

## Where layers draw

The game resolves each target's layers when they are added, so a frame finds an entity's layers with
no lookup by name and no scan over the mods; with no layer at all, it checks one flag per entity and
builds nothing. A humanoid model's posed parts are kept from its draw only for a type or player model
that has a layer (or while a mod listens to the render hook pair), so a layer on one type costs the
other mobs nothing. The layers draw on the mobs (vanilla's and the content mods' living types) and on the players,
this window's own in third person included. The armour stand and the ender dragon have draws of their
own that don't run layers, so `add` refuses them.

`render_living_post` and `render_player_post` are a different moment: they are asked for every mob
and player in view each frame, after their layers (NeoForge's `RenderLivingEvent.Post` and
`RenderPlayerEvent.Post`), for a mod that draws over every entity rather than over one type's renderer
([model drawing](model-drawing.md)).
