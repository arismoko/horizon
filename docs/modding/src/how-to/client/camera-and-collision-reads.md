# Camera and collision reads

`ClientHost::is_paused()` reads the applied client pause state, not whether a pause
screen is open. A multiplayer game continues running while its pause screen is open.
The pause-change pre hook sees the old state; the post hook sees the new state.

`ClientHost::playing()` is true while the player is in the world with nothing over it: no screen, title, sign
editor or book, so keys and zoom apply. `ClientHost::mapping(name)` reads a vanilla key mapping (`key.forward`,
`key.left`, `key.back`, `key.right`, `key.jump`, `key.sneak`, `key.sprint`, `key.attack`, `key.use`) as a
`Result<Option<KeyMapping>, TextFormError>`. `Ok(Some(mapping))` contains the held state in
`mapping.down` and the bound key's Controls label in `mapping.label`. Other names return
`Ok(None)`; an invalid label returns `TextFormError`, including components deeper than 512 nodes. Both read without `&mut`, so the HUD and screen hooks can ask them.

`ClientHost::clipboard_text()` reads the system clipboard (`KeyboardHandler.getClipboard`, empty text when it
holds none) and `ClientHost::set_clipboard_text(text)` writes it (`setClipboard`; empty text copies nothing). Both
work only while the game handles a key, mouse or typed-text event, from the window or from the control socket
(`horizon-ctl key`, `mouse`, `type` and its clicks): a key, mouse or screen hook that fires inside one, such as
Ctrl+V into a mod's own field. At any other moment (a tick, a frame, a packet) the read is `None` and the write
is `false` with nothing copied, so no mod reaches the clipboard without the player doing something. Both are
`None` and `false` on a server, and take `&self`, so a screen hook can call them. Vanilla's `KeyboardHandler`
has no such rule: Horizon adds it.

## Camera snapshots and perspective

The `ClientHost::camera()` helper returns the most recently extracted world frame's camera, or none before one exists. Its position, interpolated eye height, partial tick, angles, final FOV, near/far planes and dimension accompany column-major view and projection matrices. The view is camera-relative and includes bob and spin; projection uses reversed Z. Earlier callbacks in a frame can see the previous frame. `block_collision(pos)` returns block-local `[min_x, min_y, min_z, max_x, max_y, max_z]` boxes with an empty collision context; unloaded blocks and collision errors give no boxes.

`ClientHost::set_camera_type(type)` is a queued client-only effect and takes `&self`, so
shared callbacks such as `camera_pose` can request a perspective. `camera_type()` reports
the latest request immediately; several requests coalesce to the last one. Requests before
or during `camera_pose` apply before that frame's final camera, FOV and spectator post effects.
The pose hook runs only once: its explicit position or angle overrides survive a refreshed
vanilla camera. Requests from later render callbacks apply at the next frame's extraction.
Setting a type never emits `camera_type_cycle`; F5 alone cycles, and its final event choice
wins over requests made inside the cycle callback.

## Crosshair reads

`ClientHost::crosshair_target()` returns the ordinary interaction-range target as
`CrosshairTarget::Block { pos, state, hit }` or
`CrosshairTarget::Entity { entity, point }`. The block hit contains its world-space
location, face and inside flag; the entity point is also in world coordinates.
It uses the game's current targeting ray and block/entity reach, respects blocks
occluding entities, and returns `None` on a miss or without a client world.
It can be read with a screen open. `entity` is an `EntityRef` carrying the current
client level's epoch and network entity ID, including dragon parts. It becomes stale
when the client level is replaced or the client disconnects; a same-level respawn
keeps its epoch. This supplies identity, not client entity reads: the server-only
entity data methods reject client handles. Unlike `view_hit` and `raycast`, this does not find blocks
in distant terrain or return a block behind a targeted entity.

## Combat targeting

`ClientHost::targeting()` and `set_targeting(ClientTargeting)` control liquid picking,
entity occlusion and an optional crosshair entity override. Defaults preserve ordinary
vanilla targeting. Set `pick_liquids` to include source and flowing fluid shapes, or
`hit_through_walls` to ignore block occlusion for entity picks and attacks. An `entity`
override must name a live entity in this client level; stale or self handles make the
setter return `false` without changing the controls. The setter requires a logged-in
client world. An override is rechecked for reach, held-item range and occlusion when
used and disappears from reads after its level is replaced.

Reach remains attribute-backed: use the server player's living handle and
`set_attribute_base(host, "minecraft:block_interaction_range", value)` or
`"minecraft:entity_interaction_range"`. The client's cached reach follows the server's
attribute updates. Client targeting controls do not grant extra server reach.

`client_attack_target` receives a mutable `targets` list before an ordinary melee click
(spear jabs use their existing path). It starts with the crosshair entity. Replace it
for redirection, append for multiple hits, or clear it to suppress an entity attack.
`Flow::Cancel` cancels the batch. There is no batch cap; duplicates are sent once
in first-occurrence order. Each target is checked again against live handles,
attackability, reach, held-item range and the occlusion control. Clearing an entity hit
does not mine the block behind it; an empty list on a block or miss keeps the ordinary
path. Each accepted hit uses normal attack packets and prediction. Server validation
and cooldowns apply. Native and wasm mods use the same typed API.
