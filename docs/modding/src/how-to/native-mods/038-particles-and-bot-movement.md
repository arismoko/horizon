### Client particles

`ClientHost::add_particle` submits the API's `ParticleOptions`, a world position and
velocity to the ordinary client particle queue. The client must have a loaded player
and world. Non-finite numeric inputs are refused. A successful submission does not
promise a visible particle: provider availability, sprite sets, distance and the
player's particle settings still apply. This method is not available on `ServerHost`.

Particle options carry a `ParticleKey`, not an engine particle enum or a provider name.
Request the key with `Registrar::particle_key` during registration and retain it. The game resolves
provider identities once when content loads. `ParticleOptions::simple(key)` handles both vanilla
and custom sprite providers; custom providers still require an `assets/<namespace>/particles/<path>.json`
sprite set. All option constructors take the resolved key, including `dust`, `item`, `trail`,
`vibration`, `shriek`, `sculk_charge` and `dust_transition`. Use the corresponding vanilla key
for these parameter families. Sending an option performs no string parsing or registry scan.

For stack-derived breaking or eating particles, call
`ClientHost::item_particle_options(&stack)` and pass the returned options to
`add_particle`. This read resolves the ground model with seed 0, preserving all
layer particle sprites and resource-pack and stack-component overrides. It returns
`None` for invalid stacks or unavailable resources/provider. It is available in
Setup, Reloading and World, on native and wasm. Resolve again after resource reloads.
It allocates a sprite list only when called; it adds no per-tick work.

### Client fireworks

`ClientHost::create_fireworks` draws a firework's explosions from a `FireworksRequest`: the
position, the rocket's velocity carried by the sparks, a list of `FireworkExplosion`s (shape,
colours, fade colours, trail, twinkle) and `audible`. It uses the starter a bursting rocket
uses, so the explosions follow each other every other tick as a rocket's do. With `audible`
false the sparks and flash still draw but the blast and twinkle sounds don't play, as for a
silent rocket. Nothing reaches the server or other players: a mod's server half tells each
client half to draw it. The request is refused on a server, without a loaded client player
and world, for non-finite numbers and for more than 256 explosions.

### Bot movement and block collisions

`PlayerRef::simulate_move` predicts one server player's movement tick from
`PlayerInput`, using the game's movement implementation without replacing the
live player's body. It returns `SimulatedMove` with position, velocity, ground,
horizontal-collision and sprinting results. It refuses stale or inaccessible players,
dead players, spectators, riders and invalid numeric input. A supplied velocity is
input to the prediction, not a write to the player.

`LevelRef::collision_boxes` reads block collision boxes within a finite, ordered
axis-aligned box. It excludes entity and border collisions. A refused level or a
query covering more than 1,000,000 cells returns `None`; a valid query with no
collisions returns `Some` containing an empty vector. Keep queries bounded rather
than scanning a whole level each tick.

`LevelRef::block_shape(host, state, pos, kind)` reads an explicit `BlockState`'s
outline or collision boxes with an empty context at a position in that level.
The supplied state can differ from the world's block, without changing it;
level-dependent shape inputs still come from the actual level. To query the
stored block, first read `level.block_state(host, pos)` and pass that state.
This server read returns block-local boxes, or `None` for an unknown state,
stale handle, closed level or client. Parked levels are supported.

These queries take typed handles for their natural receiver. There are no parallel
UUID-only or dimension-string helpers.
