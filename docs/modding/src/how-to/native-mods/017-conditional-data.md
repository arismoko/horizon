### Conditional data

Server JSON files can carry a `neoforge:conditions` array. Supported readers are
recipes, loot tables, item modifiers, predicates, enchantments, jukebox songs,
instruments, damage types, advancements, synchronized registry JSON, world-table
tags (including loot, damage, synchronized registry and function tags), and native item/block data maps.
Every condition must hold; a false condition omits the file. Mods can
[register conditions](../../concepts/load-conditions.md) for this same evaluator.
Register one handler per id using the read-only `RegistrationContext`. A handler
reads the condition's JSON from a borrowed raw value and validates its own
arguments. Invalid mod input must return `ConditionError`, never panic.

Ordinary JSON resources select the winning pack file first, then evaluate its
conditions before decoding the data. If the winner is omitted, a lower pack's
version does not return. Tags and data maps evaluate each layer before merging,
`replace`, or `remove`, so an omitted layer leaves lower entries intact. A damage
registry is frozen at world open; reloading reevaluates its tags, not its type
definitions. Generated item default components retain their existing prototype
lifetime and are not conditional data files.

`neoforge:mod_loaded` asks the owning resource generation's captured enabled
server-mod IDs, including active code-only native and WebAssembly mods, plus
`minecraft` always. Client-only, disabled and refused packages are absent;
resource namespaces are not mod IDs. Other supported forms are `neoforge:true`,
`neoforge:not` (`value`), and `neoforge:and` / `neoforge:or` (`values`). A namespace
is owned only when a loaded mod registered at least one condition in it. Unknown
names there refuse reload, naming the file, condition and mod, at any depth in
these trees. **Diverges from upstream:** refusing reload for an unknown name in
an owned namespace is a Horizon addition. Typed-codec alignment is a later item,
to revisit once the shared codec foundation exists
([#811](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/811) and
[#2332](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/2332)).
Foreign unknown names leave the file
absent and produce one ERROR-level log entry per candidate reload naming the
file and its distinct unknown ids (the vanilla view outside a reload logs per
evaluation). Every branch of `not`, `and` and `or` is visited, at every depth:
`or(true, othermod:unknown)` is absent even though its first branch is true.
Foreign unknown ids do not themselves refuse the whole reload.
A file without the conditions array loads normally. Successful reloads publish
changed enabled IDs together with the data generation, including command predicates
and item modifiers; retained readers keep
their old snapshot. Callback errors also refuse publication and keep the previous
usable generation. Native and wasm registrations use the same route.
