# Build log

The full log of a build is `native/build.log`, beside the build's own folders under the launcher's data
folder. Each new attempt replaces it. Compiler output and the final result
stay in the log, including failures before compilation or while selecting or exporting the built game.

Choose **Build log** at the top right to open the latest build's log. The action is available
whenever a log exists, including after restarting the launcher. Each build replaces that log. The
panel shows a bounded preview of the end of the log and says when it truncated; **Copy log** copies the
whole file, **Open full log** opens it outside the launcher, **Show in folder** reveals it, and
**Refresh** reads it again (also after a build finishes). The panel is a snapshot read on open and
refresh, not a live stream: a running build's later output appears only on the next refresh. Nothing is
uploaded; the log stays on the player's computer.
