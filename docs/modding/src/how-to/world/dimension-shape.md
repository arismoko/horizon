# Dimension shape

## Dimension keys

`LevelRef::dimension` returns a `DimensionKey`, a small `Copy` value that names the dimension
for as long as the game runs, custom dimensions included. Compare it with another key or with
`DimensionKey::OVERWORLD`, `NETHER` and `END`; `level.dimension().id(host)` gives the name
(`minecraft:the_nether`). On a client, `host.level(name)` gives the level it shows under the
name the server calls it, whether or not that is a vanilla dimension.

## Dimension shape

`LevelRef::dimension_shape` reads the loaded server level's build range, logical height,
skylight and ceiling from its dimension shape. It accepts `&dyn Host`, including when the
level is parked, and returns `None` for a stale or unavailable level or on a client. It does
not load a level or allocate.

## Dimension type

`level.dimension_type(host)` reads a level's dimension type (`Level.dimensionType()` and its
gameplay attributes) as a `LevelDimensionType`: the build range, `coordinate_scale`, `ambient_light`,
`has_fixed_time`, `infiniburn`, the monster spawn light range, the sky and the gameplay switches. A
level on a vanilla type returns that type's values, a registered dimension returns what its
`DimensionSettings` set, and a data pack's dimension type counts the same way. It returns `None` for
a stale handle. On a client, it reads the displayed level's received dimension type,
including custom types sent by another server.

## Registering a dimension

`register_dimension` gives every world a level of the mod's own. Call it once, at startup, in
`Hooks::register`:

```rust,ignore
#[mod_api::horizon_mod]
impl Hooks for MyMod {
    fn register(&self, r: &mut dyn Registrar, _: &RegistrationContext) {
        r.register_dimension(
            "pocket",
            DimensionSettings { min_y: -128, height: 448, logical_height: 448, ..Default::default() },
        );
    }
}
```

The level is `mymod:pocket`. `DimensionSettings` sets the build height, `has_skylight`,
`has_ceiling`, the `generator` (`minecraft:noise` by default), its `noise_settings` and the level's
one `biome`; the default is the Overworld's shape and terrain over plains. It also sets the rest of
the dimension type the game reads: `has_fixed_time`, `has_ender_dragon_fight`, `coordinate_scale`,
`ambient_light`, `infiniburn`, the monster spawn light range and block light limit, the `skybox`,
the `cardinal_light` and the gameplay switches (`water_evaporates`, `fast_lava`,
`respawn_anchor_works`, `nether_portal_spawns_piglin`, `piglins_zombify`, `snow_golem_melts`,
`can_start_raid`, `sky_light_level`) and the bed rule (`bed_can_sleep`, `bed_can_set_spawn`,
`bed_destroy_on_use`, `bed_destroy_on_leave`: the first two accept `always`, `when_dark` or `never`;
the last two are boolean flags controlling destruction on use or leave; the same four with `straw_bed_` for the straw bed). A field left at its default is the Overworld's, and the game
refuses a value out of range (a `coordinate_scale` outside 0.00001 to 30000000, an `ambient_light` that is not a number, an unknown
`skybox`, a bed rule that is none of the three) at startup with a message naming the mod. The
`coordinate_scale` is what `execute in mymod:pocket` scales a position by, and what a portal
between two levels scales by (`DimensionType.getTeleportationScale`); a position given to a
teleport call is taken as it is. The level opens, ticks, saves and closes as the
Nether and the End do, in `dimensions/mymod/pocket/` of the world, and clients receive its
dimension type when they join. A client of a server takes the whole type, not only the build
range: the level's fluids, mobs, beds and time follow the type the server sent, as on the host,
whether or not the client has the mod that registered the level.

`sky_color`, `fog_color` (`#rrggbb`) and `cloud_height` set the sky overhead, the fog at the
horizon and the clouds' height; left as None they are the Overworld's. A client of a server draws a
level of a mod or a pack with the sky the server's type gives it, as the host does.

`day_cycle` picks the timelines and the clock the dimension type names: `overworld` (the day and moon
cycles, the villagers' schedule and the Overworld's clock, the default), `nether` (the schedule only,
no clock), `end` or `none`. It sets how the level's sky and light change over the day in the host's
world, whether monsters burn in daylight, and which clock `/time` reads there. `level.dimension_type(host)`
gives the timelines and `default_clock` back. Use `level.clock_time(host)` for the dimension's default clock and `level.day_time(host)` for the Overworld clock.

The level's biomes are the one `biome` everywhere unless `biome_source` says otherwise:
`BiomeSourceKind::Checkerboard` alternates the `biomes` in cells `2^biome_scale` chunks wide,
`MultiNoise` uses the Overworld's or the Nether's biomes (`biome_preset`) and `End` the End's islands.
`Points` places the mod's own biomes: `biome_points` lists a `BiomePoint` per biome, with an interval
(`(min, max)`, each from -2 to 2, a single value is `(v, v)`) for temperature, humidity, continentalness,
erosion, depth and weirdness, and an `offset` from 0 to 1. The biome whose point is nearest to the level's
climate at a position wins, as in a data pack's `minecraft:multi_noise` source with an inline `biomes` list;
the biomes can be the mod's own or vanilla's. A mod's points shape its own level only: placing a mod's biomes
among vanilla's in the Overworld or the Nether is a [biome region](../content-mods/biome-regions.md). Only `Fixed` suits a chunk
generator of the mod's own. `mod_biome_source` names a [biome source](#biome-sources) a
mod registered instead, for either generator.

A dimension in an unowned namespace, an empty name, a name that is not a folder of the world
(lowercase letters, digits and `_ . -` only, with `/` between segments that are not empty, `.` or
`..`), a vanilla level's id, an id registered twice, a build height the dimension type codec refuses
(`min_y` and `height` are multiples of 16, and the level stays between -2032 and 2031) and a
generator nobody registered stop the game at startup with a message naming the mod. The generator
may come from a mod that loads later.

A registered dimension is the level stem and dimension type a data pack would give, below every
data pack: a pack with `data/mymod/dimension/pocket.json` or `data/mymod/dimension_type/pocket.json`
replaces that half of it, in the worlds that have the pack.

`register_dimension` is the same call in a mod built to `mod.wasm`, as the settings are plain
data. A wasm mod's dimension can name only the game's own generator, `minecraft:noise`, with a
vanilla biome source or one a native mod registered: a chunk generator and a biome source are code,
and `register_chunk_generator` and `register_biome_source` are native only.

## Sending a player to a dimension

There is no portal to a registered level. A mod sends an entity there with
`entity.teleport_to_level(host, dimension, pos, rotation)` from a server hook, the call vanilla has
as `Entity.teleport` with a portal's transition. It works for a player, a mob, a boat, a minecart
(a vehicle takes its passengers along), an item, a primed TNT, an experience orb, an arrow, a
trident, a firework and the thrown items and fireballs a chunk saves. The entity keeps its motion;
set it first with `entity.set_velocity` to stop or turn it.

```rust,ignore
fn run_mod_command(&self, host: &mut dyn ServerHost, event: &mut RunModCommandEvent<'_>) -> Flow {
    let CommandSource::Player { player, .. } = event.source else {
        return Flow::Continue;
    };
    let entity = player.entity();
    entity.teleport_to_level(host, "mymod:pocket", [8.5, 100.0, 8.5], None);
    Flow::Cancel
}
```

`pos` is in the destination's own coordinates: nothing scales it by the level's
`coordinate_scale`. A level nobody has entered opens first, and a player arrives after the current
tick, when `player_teleported` and `player_changed_dimension` report the move. The call
answers whether the move was taken, not whether the player arrived: a level that won't open, such
as one naming a generator nobody registered, logs an error and leaves the player where they were.
It is false for an unregistered dimension and for an entity that cannot change level (an item, an
orb, a projectile); a fake player stays where it is. Nothing builds a platform at the destination, so look for the
ground first, or place one.

## Sea level

`level.sea_level(host)` reads `Level.getSeaLevel`: 63 in the Overworld, 32 in the Nether, 0 in the End. For a level of
the noise generator it is the `sea_level` of its noise settings, a data pack's too when it replaces them. A level
of a chunk generator the mod wrote has no noise settings to read: set `DimensionSettings::sea_level` to give it one
(a level of the noise generator keeps its noise settings'), else it is 63 (-63 for a superflat generator). It is the sea
level the game uses for the level: mob spawning and behaviour (drowned, turtles, phantoms), rain and snow, and maps.
Terrain and aquifers are built with the generator's own sea level, which for a noise level is the noise settings' and
which `DimensionSettings::sea_level` never changes: it only gives `level.sea_level(host)` a value for a generator that has
none, so it does not move where the water is.

## Day clocks

Each level goes by its dimension type's `default_clock`: the Overworld by `minecraft:overworld`, the End by
`minecraft:the_end`, a level without one (the Nether) by the Overworld's. Every clock the world has met runs at its
own rate and keeps its own total, saved in `world_clocks.dat`, so a level with a clock of its own has its own day:
its sky, its spawning and its beds follow that clock, and `/time` in the level sets it.
`level.clock_time(host)` reads the level's own clock in ticks (`None` on a client, for a stale handle or for a level without a default clock);
`level.day_time(host)` reads the Overworld's clock, whichever level you ask.

## Which level a hook is in

The block-behaviour hooks (`neighbor_changed`, `random_tick`, `crop_grow`, `block_changed` and the rest) name their
level with a `LevelDimension`: `Overworld`, `Nether`, `End`, or `Custom(key)` for any other level, a mod's or a data
pack's. `LevelDimension::key()` gives the level's key (`key.id()` its `namespace:path`) and `LevelDimension::of_level`
goes back. Match it with a final `Custom(_)` arm. The game's own rules read the level's own dimension type for these
too (water that evaporates, fast lava, infiniburn, piglin portals), and `player_respawn_position` may send a player to
a `Custom` level.

## Players, structures and chunk watchers

`level.online_players(host)` lists the real online players in that server level, including
when it is parked. Obtain a chunk with `host.chunk(level, pos)`, then call
`chunk.watchers(host)` to ask which players were sent it and have it inside their
view distance; fake players watch nothing.

`level.find_nearest_structure(host, structure, StructureSearch::new(origin, radius))` searches
for a structure id or `#tag` and returns its structure and locate position. This is a
synchronous, `/locate`-cost search, not a cheap loaded-chunk lookup: cache results and avoid
per-tick use. The radius counts placement-cell rings (at most 100); stronghold rings are
checked regardless of radius. It does not load or generate chunks.

## Watered-area tickets

On the server, `level.add_water_ticket(host, min, max)` returns an `Option<WaterTicket>`
for a sprinkler's watered area. Bounds are integer and half-open on **all three axes**:
`min` is included, `max` is excluded. For 5×1×5 farmland beginning at `[4, 64, 4]`,
use `[4, 64, 4]` and `[9, 65, 9]`; `[8, 64, 8]` is inside, `[9, 64, 4]` is outside.
Empty or reversed boxes and boxes covering more than 65,536 x/z chunks are refused.

Keep the handle, then call `ticket.remove(host)` when the sprinkler stops or breaks.
Removal returns whether that ticket was removed; overlapping tickets remain independent.
Only the mod that added a ticket can remove it. `level.has_water_ticket(host, pos)` tests
whether any ticket covers a block. Both calls reach active or parked server levels without
loading chunks; unavailable/stale handles and clients answer `false` (adding answers `None`).
Adding requires an enabled mod call, and native and wasm use the same generated boundary.

Tickets are chunk-indexed, in memory only, and never force chunks to load. They are removed
on explicit removal, level unload, or their owner's disable; re-enabling does not restore
them. A reopened world starts empty: re-add from `level_load` or a block entity's load
listener. Several boxes can describe a shape without a per-position mod predicate.
Farmland checks the ticket before its vanilla water scan, so dry farmland inside moistens
to 7. Removing the last covering ticket restores normal drying, while nearby water and
rain continue working normally and the moisture-change veto still applies. Empty levels
pay only the empty-index guard, not a mod scan or callback.

## Saving a level

`level.request_save(host)` asks the server to save a level, as the autosave and `/save-all` do, with its
chunks on disk when it ends. The save runs at the start of the next server tick, not inside the call (a hook
may be running in the tick that is saving), and a level asked for twice before then is saved once. The call
answers whether the request was taken. `level_save` fires with the level's dimension once it was written; a
save that fails fires nothing and is logged.

Inside a hook, use `level.request_save(host)`, not a synchronous `save-all` command.
While an entity pass or held-out row is borrowed, synchronous saving refuses with vanilla's
`commands.save.failed` feedback and a failed command result, without writing a partial snapshot.
Requested saves wait for a settled start-of-tick boundary.

## Chunk generators


A chunk generator is a mod's code for a level's terrain: vanilla's `ChunkGenerator`, and
`build_terrain` its `buildTerrain`. Register it once, at startup, and name it from a dimension,
or from a data pack's level stem as `"generator": {"type": "mymod:void"}`:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/src/worldgen.rs:terrain}}
```

There is no `Host` in world generation: chunks fill on the worker threads, so a generator sees only
the `ChunkAccess` of the chunk it fills, is `Send + Sync`, and keeps no mutable state, because two
workers can fill neighbouring chunks at once. The same seed and chunk give the same blocks.
`ChunkAccess` has the chunk's `pos`, the world's `seed`, the level's `min_y` and `height`, and
borrowed immutable `metadata()`. Resolve `BlockKey`s at registration, then use `state` or
`state_with` to construct API-owned `BlockState`s before the terrain-writing loop, never once per
placed block. `set_block` skips a position outside the chunk or build height and answers whether
it wrote. The chunk starts as air; invalid state ordinals are refused rather than written.

By default the generator gives terrain only: the level has no surface, carvers, structures or
features, every chunk has the stem's one biome, unless its stem names a
[biome source](#biome-sources) a mod registered, and `noise_settings` means nothing to it.

`vanilla_stages` asks for vanilla's stages around the terrain, as `VanillaStages` with the fields
`surface`, `carvers`, `structures` and `features`; it is asked once, at registration. They run in
vanilla's order: the structure starts before the terrain, then the level's material rule
(`surface`: grass, sand, deepslate, bedrock and ore veins over every solid block) and its biomes'
carvers, as vanilla's noise generator runs them after its noise fill, then the structure pieces
and the biomes' placed features. The material rule, the carvers' aquifer and the height a structure
starts at come from the level's `noise_settings`, not from the generator's terrain, and so does its
sea level. With any stage, `ChunkAccess`'s `min_y` and `height` are the noise settings' range and
`set_block` writes only inside it, as vanilla's noise fill does. A world with its structures turned
off gets none. A level whose stem names no noise settings or ones the world lacks, one that asks for
structures in a world with no structure sets or for structures or features in one with no placed
features, and one that asks for features the game cannot place yet, refuses to open with a message
naming the generator and what is missing; the surface and the carvers alone need neither. A level that asks for none of them costs
what it did before; one that asks for any runs on vanilla's generator, with the mod's terrain in
place of the noise.

A generator in an unowned namespace, an empty name, a name that is not a folder of the world (as
for a dimension), an id registered twice and `minecraft:noise` stop the game at startup with a
message naming the mod. Wasm mods can register dimensions using `minecraft:noise`, but cannot register a chunk generator.

A level stem naming a generator nobody registered, say after its mod was removed, is an error for
whoever opens that level, not for the world: a teleport there fails and is logged, and a player
saved there joins a server in the Overworld. Single player refuses to open a world whose player is
saved in such a level.

### Biome sources

A biome source is a mod's code for where a level's biomes go: vanilla's `BiomeSource`, with
`possible_biomes` its `possibleBiomes` and `noise_biome` its `getNoiseBiome`. Register it once, at
startup, and name it from a dimension's `mod_biome_source`, or from a data pack's level stem as
`"biome_source": {"type": "mymod:chaos"}`:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/src/worldgen.rs:biome_source}}
```

`possible_biomes` lists the biome ids the source places, vanilla's, a data pack's or the mod's own;
it is asked once, at registration. `noise_biome` answers for one quart cell (a block position >> 2,
`[x, y, z]`) of a world with `seed`, with an index into that list; an index past the end wraps
around it. It runs on the worldgen worker threads for every 4x4x4 cell of every chunk generated, with
no `Host`, so it is `Send + Sync`, keeps no mutable state and does not allocate. The same seed and
cell give the same biome.

The source serves the game's noise generator, whose structures and decoration read its possible
biomes as they read a vanilla source's, and a chunk generator of a mod's own, whose chunks then
get its biomes cell by cell instead of one biome. The biomes are saved with the chunks, by name, as
any other.

A source in another mod's namespace, an empty name, a name that is not a folder of the world (as
for a dimension), an id registered twice and an empty `possible_biomes` stop the game at startup
with a message naming the mod, and so does a dimension whose `mod_biome_source` nobody registered.
The source may come from a mod that loads later. A level whose world lacks one of the possible
biomes refuses to open, naming the source and the biome, as does a level stem naming a source that
is gone. A wasm mod's registrar refuses `register_biome_source`, naming the source: `BiomeSource`
is not bound by the generated wasm worker interface.
