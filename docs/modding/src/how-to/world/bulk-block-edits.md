# Typed bulk block edits

`BlockEdit.palette` contains complete `BlockState` values. Construct them with
`BlockState::of(&host.block_states(), block, constraints)` (or change an existing state
with `with`). `filters` contains owned `StatePredicate` values. `StatePredicate::block`
validates property names and values strictly; `StatePredicate::tag` retains arbitrary
property requirements, including for an empty tag, and rejects duplicate properties.

A predicate requires block identity or tag membership AND every supplied property.
Omitted properties are wildcards, never default-state requirements. An unknown or
missing property on a tag member never matches. Sparse, non-Cartesian state tables
are supported: a partial predicate does not need to form a complete state with defaults.

All palette entries, predicates and run indices are prepared before any mutation.
NBT is not representable. At most 65,536 filters are allowed. Unloaded chunks and
out-of-height portions of runs are skipped. Edits preserve strict block-entity behavior,
notify no neighbors and send whole changed chunks.

`ColumnBlocks.palette` also contains complete `BlockState` values. States of the
same block with different properties have distinct entries. Only distinct numeric
states are converted to API values, not each block in the returned columns.
