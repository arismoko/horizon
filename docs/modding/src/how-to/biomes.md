# Biomes

What a mod can do with biomes, by what it wants. Each row names the call or file; the pages it links to give the detail.

| I want to | Use | Side |
|---|---|---|
| Add a biome | `data/<ns>/worldgen/biome/<name>.json` in a content mod or data pack ([content mods](content-mods.md)) | Content |
| Add my features or spawns to vanilla's biomes | `Registrar::declare_biome_modifier` or a file in `data/<ns>/neoforge/biome_modifier/` ([content mods](content-mods.md)) | Content |
| Give my dimension its own biomes | `DimensionSettings::biome_source`: `Fixed`, `Checkerboard`, `MultiNoise` by preset, `End`, or `Points` for an explicit climate-point layout ([dimension shape](native-mods/008-dimension-shape.md)) | Both |
| Put my biomes among the Overworld's or the Nether's | `Registrar::declare_biome_region` with a weighted `BiomeRegion` ([biome regions](biome-regions.md)) | Both |
| Know the biome at a position | `LevelRef::biome_at` on a server level, `LevelRef::client_biome` on a client | Server, client |
| Find the nearest biome or tag | `LevelRef::find_closest_biome` with a `BiomeSearch` | Server |
| Change a biome | `LevelRef::set_biome`, one 4x4x4 cell, as `/fillbiome` does | Server |
| Run bone meal at a position | `LevelRef::bone_meal` | Server |
| Tint foliage, grass or water by biome | The `register_color_resolvers` hook for new colour resolvers, and the `biome_colors` hook to change a biome's own colours | Client |

Code and file modifiers support features, spawns, spawn costs, carvers, climate and effects. They apply additions,
then removals, then modifications when the world loads, after its data packs. Mods cannot choose explicit phases
or supply custom biome-modifier serializers ([content mods](content-mods.md)).

## What is not here yet

- Adopting the installed mods' biome regions from the client's world list; a dedicated server can already ([arismoko/horizon#2554](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/2554)).
- Full custom biome-modifier serializers and explicit phases between modifiers ([#2732](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/2732)).
- A mod's own worldgen registry loaded into the world ([#811](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/811)).
- Features and placers defined in code ([#815](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/815)).

Some of these have a PR open; a page for each lands with it.

## Reads and writes are limited on purpose

- `biome_at` never loads or generates a chunk: an unloaded column answers `None`.
- `find_closest_biome` follows vanilla's sampled spiral, so it is not a search through cells a mod edited, and it refuses a search whose sample count passes `BiomeSearch::MAX_SAMPLES`.
- `set_biome` refuses a client, an unknown biome and an unchanged cell, and returns false rather than an error.
