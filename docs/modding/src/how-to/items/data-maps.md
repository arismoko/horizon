# Reading data maps

A data map attaches a value to the entries of a registry (NeoForge's `DataMapType`): any registry
the game names, built in (`minecraft:item`, `minecraft:entity_type`, `minecraft:worldgen/biome`...),
a pack's or a datapack registry a mod declares. Data packs and mods' files set the values; a mod reads
what the server made of them, so a server pack can rebalance a mod's numbers without a rebuild.

Describe the map once with `DataMap`: its id, the registry its entries are in (`Entry`: an
`ItemKey`, `BlockKey`, `FluidKey`, `EffectKey`, `EntityTypeKey`, `EnchantmentKey`,
`BlockEntityTypeKey` or `ProfessionKey`), and how a value decodes. Values arrive as the NBT form of the JSON a
file held: a whole number is an `Int`, or a `Long` past `i32`, a fraction a `Double`, a boolean a
`Byte`, an object a `Compound` and an array a `List`. Integer tokens must fit signed
64-bit NBT `Long`; larger unsigned integers return `DataMapError::Undecodable`,
never a rounded `Double`. Fractional/exponent tokens use the JSON parser's `f64`
value (including an integral value written as `1.0`). A JSON `null` anywhere in a
value also refuses the entire read as `Undecodable`; it is not an empty string.
Empty and heterogeneous arrays preserve their elements as in-memory `List` values.
These rules are identical for native and wasm readers.

```rust,ignore
use mod_api::{DataMap, DataMapTypesEvent, ItemKey, ServerHost, Tag};

/// `mymod:emc`: an item's value.
struct Emc;
impl DataMap for Emc {
    type Entry = ItemKey;
    type Value = i64;
    fn id(&self) -> &str {
        "mymod:emc"
    }
    fn decode(&self, value: &Tag) -> Option<i64> {
        match value {
            Tag::Int(value) => Some(i64::from(*value)),
            Tag::Long(value) => Some(*value),
            _ => None,
        }
    }
}

// In `impl Hooks`: register it each time the server loads its data.
fn data_map_types(&self, _: &mut dyn ServerHost, event: &mut DataMapTypesEvent<'_>) {
    event.types.push(Emc.ty());
}
```

Its values are `data/mymod/data_maps/item/emc.json` in any data pack, and files the mod pushes
through `data_pack_files` under `data_maps/mymod:item/emc`. The folder is the registry's path for
a `minecraft` registry (`entity_type`, `worldgen/biome`) and `<namespace>/<path>` for another.
An id the registry doesn't hold is skipped, with one warning per file. A value may carry its own
load conditions (`WithConditions`): it counts only when they hold.

```json
{ "values": {
    "minecraft:coal": 10,
    "#minecraft:logs": 32,
    "create:zinc_ingot": {
      "neoforge:conditions": [{ "type": "neoforge:mod_loaded", "modid": "create" }],
      "value": 64
    }
} }
```

Read an entry with its key's `data` (`item.data(host, &Emc)`, `entity_type.data(host, &map)`),
from any hook with a host. A registry without a typed key is read by name:
`data_map_value(host, "minecraft:worldgen/biome", "minecraft:plains", "mymod:heat")` gives the
raw `Tag`, and `data_map_entries(host, registry, map)` the whole map, every entry with a value in
id order (`IRegistryExtension.getDataMap`). The answers are:

- `Ok(Some(value))`: the merged value. The newest file wins, a `#tag` gives every entry in it the
  value, `replace` drops what earlier files set and `remove` takes entries away.
- `Ok(None)`: the map gives this entry no value.
- `Err(DataMapError::UnknownType)`: no mod registered the map for that registry in this load.
- `Err(DataMapError::Undecodable)`: the value is not one `decode` takes.
- `Err(DataMapError::Unavailable)`: no maps are loaded here. Data maps live on the server (the
  single player server thread included) and are not synced to clients, so a client returns
  this error, as does a server before its world's data first loads.

The server merges every map when its data loads: a world's first open and every `/reload`. A
read sees the last load whole, never part of one, and a value a reload drops is gone at once.
`data_maps_updated` fires after each load. Use it to rebuild anything computed from the
values. Reads also work in world hooks. A lookup reads the loaded map: it parses nothing and
touches no file.

Wasm mods read data maps the same way, with the same answers.

## NeoForge's built-in block maps

The game itself reads three of NeoForge's block maps (`NeoForgeDataMaps`), with no code in your
mod: `neoforge:flammable`, `neoforge:oxidizables` and `neoforge:waxables`, in
`data/neoforge/data_maps/block/<name>.json`. They load from the world's data packs and mods'
files on every server data load, merged as your own maps are, and each load replaces the last.

```json
{ "values": { "mymod:tin": { "next_oxidation_stage": "mymod:dull_tin" } } }
```

- `neoforge:flammable` (`ignite_odds`, `burn_odds`): fire asks a mod's fire hook first, then this
  map, then vanilla's table. Burn odds are clamped to 300, as a hook's answer is.
- `neoforge:oxidizables` (`next_oxidation_stage`): the stage a random tick weathers a block to, its
  properties kept. A mapped block weathers only where the game's weathering already ticks it
  (vanilla's copper blocks), so naming another block does not make it age by itself.
- `neoforge:waxables` (`waxed`): the twin honeycomb waxes a block to, for the player's honeycomb
  and the dispenser's, its properties kept.

The axe reads the inverse maps before its own transform table: the oxidation inverse scrapes one
stage back, the waxing inverse takes the wax off. They are derived from the forward maps on every
load, never declared. Where several blocks share a next stage or a waxed twin, the one with the
lowest block registry id is the one given back. That is a Horizon choice: NeoForge keeps whichever
its map iteration met last.

Random-tick oxidation, honeycomb, dispenser waxing and the axe each move exactly one step, so a
chain that loops only alternates there. Lightning resets a struck block along the whole oxidation
inverse. So that mod data can never hang it, an oxidation chain that loops (a block that is its own
next stage included) is refused at load with an error naming `neoforge:oxidizables` and the
blocks, and those blocks get no scraping step; the lightning walk also stops where it would come
back to a block it already passed. Lightning's waxed check, the carved pumpkin and the copper chest
keep vanilla's own lists. A block the maps don't name keeps vanilla's behaviour.

`generate_block_transform`, `neoforge:transformables` and `block_transform_appenders` are not read
yet ([#3359](https://github.com/arismoko/horizon/issues/3359)).
