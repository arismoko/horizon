# Concepts

<!-- The concept-pages preprocessor adds every other page of concepts/ (and of how-to/ under How-to)
     after the ones listed here, in title order, and fails the build on a page the book doesn't render.
     List a page here only to place it first or to show it in a part outside its folder. Aggregate
     chapters keep their published anchors; their child chapters are discovered too. -->
